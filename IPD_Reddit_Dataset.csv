"I got accepted into a Graduate program I wanted. But before that this was the journey, that took place over 7 years -&gt;

I spent several years in and our of city college in Florida

\-&gt;

I dropped out several times.

\-&gt;

survived a suicide attempt.

\- &gt;

Years later I ended up healing, took the Learning disability test at the College Center turns out I scored higher than top 1% verbal score wise, while simultaneously have a learning disability in mathematics this was all news to me, I thought I was stupid before the test.

\-&gt;

Got a math waiver to help me with the Math requirement.

\-&gt;

Than I awoke a spark enrolled in a 4 year local university after completing and retaking dropped classes about 15-20 units

\-&gt;

finished my Undergrad degree with two minors 1st in Philosophy and a 2nd in Ethics with Honors in the Phil and Ethics minors.

\-&gt;

I Prayed.

\-&gt;

I just got accepted into my Grad Program of Choice at an accredited divinity school, Graduate Program.

I am feeling fucking stoked, it was a long ass journey though.",0

"so i'm nonbinary and despite knowing that most of our teachers are pretty accepting and chill, i've always been way too anxious to talk to any of them about anything like this, but after one of my other trans friends talked to our class teacher about trans issues and he was pretty relaxed about it, i decided i would come out to him and ask if he could use my chosen name instead of my deadname. i chickened out and a friend of mine talked to him about it instead. he has been trying to use my chosen name since, he slips up a lot but he's been trying, which is already making me feel great. after that it took me a while but i eventually worked up the courage to even go up to a few of my other teachers as well and i even told them myself despite having massive anxiety about it! so far i've told five of my teachers and they were all so supportive about it! they all either immediately used my chosen name or said they would try their best to get used to it and stop deadnaming me. i have two more teachers i want to tell and the rest i'm too anxious to talk to yet, but still! i can't believe it worked out that well, i've been wanting to do this for such a long time and now that i finally am getting myself to talk to them, it feels amazing. i haven't worked up the courage to talk to any of them on my own yet, so far at least one of two friends has always been with me (which i'm super grateful for by the way, they are amazing and i couldn't imagine better friends) but still, this is more than i ever could've dreamt of doing, my anxiety has always been extremely limiting to me and this is so freeing and showing me that maybe i can do it after all.",0
"The university I got into isn't very hard to get into. However, in my acceptance letter, I got titled an Outstanding Scholar for being ""academically-accomplished"".

I have no idea how I got the scholarship just like that. My English/writing grades are good, but some of my other grades aren't. I did submit an optional essay about creative writing that I'm proud of, but I'm not sure if my essay influenced my chances of a scholarship or not. I feel like I got massively lucky.

I literally got the letter thirty minutes ago and I'm still in shock. I'm literally crying. I get to eat wherever I want tonight, and I can't wait to tell my friends tomorrow.",0
"tldr at bottom

We were all preparing a open house day for our culinary school where as I was preparing the baking area with others. I made sure everyone was comfortable and had to keep an eye on girl S as she tends to be very judgmental and comment on every small thing people do( all from peoples personal eating habits to how someone holds a salt shaker)

 Today she had kept commenting, on how I, a several year experienced baker brushed my cinnamon buns, a tiny detail like that, in which I told her calmly ""I've made cinnamon buns before, believe it or not."" causing her to comment more on every action I did. Later on she went on her lunch shift ( we had shifts so every station had students handling guests at any time) and she manages to get a good time to sit with most our mutual friends. 

They later come to me after school telling me all the awful things she said about me. Bossy, strict, everything! It made me upset up until they also told me almost all of them instantly told her off and that they've never experienced me being bossy or any title alike, but in fact being very caring and supportive and told her to instead lay off the unnecessary comments as they've heard how she judges people so much. Thinking about this makes me to this day so extremely happy. I feel happy knowing how well my friends think of me but also that they're so loyal to defend me that quickly!!

TL;DR A classmate told my friends I was bossy they disagreed and said we stan our friend and I happy",0

"Hey reddit. I guess I just wanted to share how excited and happy I am to be in my current relationship. I've known her for quite awhile now and she recently bought a house. I was surprised when she asked me to move in but over the past few months we have been working on fixing up the house and it's coming together really well. The entire process has really helped us grow closer and I've never loved someone the way I love my girlfriend. I have learned more about myself and what I am capable of doing and providing for someone through this entire process, and I feel like it has helped me grow as a man and a person in all facets of our lives together and my life apart.

She has brought out some amazing parts of me over the course of our relationship and I am so excited and hopeful for what is next. I've experienced a good amount of professional success and personal achievement over the last few years, but nothing makes me feel better than the feeling I have when I think about the idea of building a future and family with this amazing woman. I am beyond lucky and blessed and I am so proud of what we have, it's the most healthy and stable relationship I've ever been in, spoken as someone who has significant amounts of childhood trauma and a large history of abandonment, sorry to say.

I'll take any tips to keep things run smoothly, but for now, I am so confident, happy and excited for this next big step. It just feels different.",0

"Honestly the amount of serendipity that went into all of this is just mind boggling, but a seller just accepted our offer and we close on the 2nd (assuming all is well with the inspection) on a literal Victorian mansion that comes with its own nameâ€¦itâ€™s called the lionâ€™s den. Has lion statues and shitâ€¦even a bas relief of a naked lady all Greek/Roman style.

This is the sort of house I never thought Iâ€™d live in, and after the realtor called to tell us the seller accepted I literally cried tears of joy.

$145,000 for a 4400sqft mansionâ€¦and considering you canâ€™t buy a ramshackle crackhouse for that price in some cities, youâ€™d be amazed how well off it is. No major problems I or my grandfather (a structural engineer) could find.",0
Just had a really pleasant day at the salon! My nail tech is the best. Sheâ€™s in her early 30s and Iâ€™m in my early 20s. We connect really well and today I had an appointment which I feel gets better every time. Weâ€™re the only ones at the salon when I get my nails done so we talk about anything and everything. Sheâ€™s great and i donâ€™t really have any friends I talk to anymore so she really made my day talking for 3 and a half hours during the apt and an hour after my nails were done! ðŸ˜Š and my nails look amazingggg ðŸ’•,0

I always noted how they look better than many celebrities and anime characters, but I didn't know that they're the main users of the courier delivery app I'm on, with their little coffee,candy,cloth,art shops, and that they're modest not only with clothes, but with manners, always nice, with zero signs of scoffing at the dust on my boots or my self-haircut, welcoming to sit and drink some water.
It's not like I am much into girls, even, I was usually into the ""scientific dreams"" atmosphere of the former era. But this is also good, easy to get used to it and look forward to a new day. Even though I'll have to settle for an average woman, it's still nice to be around the waifus.",0

"i had endured a brutal abusive and manipulative friendship for 5 years. i eventually got the courage to leave, but the time after that was just as bad. i had no place to go, only one real friend, who ended up distancing herself from me because of manipulation by my old toxic friends, whom she was still hanging around. my mental health was at its lowest, and i considered suicide daily. i didnâ€™t feel like i belonged anywhere, and it was crushing me.
about a month before covid, i reconciled with the one friend i had, and she added me to a group chat with two of her new friends (who i was extremely jealous of because when we werenâ€™t as close she would hang out with them instead of me). we hung out twice, and i had a lot of fun, but was still incredibly scared to open up. when lockdown began, i was terrified of loosing this new friendship. but instead of being isolated due to not knowing them for long, the 4 of us facetimed every day, played games, and texted for hours. we hung out a ton when it became allowed, and i was finally starting to feel comfortable. i was able to open up to them about my mental health, which was something i had never done before, and they welcomed my struggles with open arms, promising to help if i need it.
itâ€™s been over a year since then, and our friend group has grown and i couldnâ€™t be more grateful. iâ€™m so incredibly and genuinely happy for the first time since i was little.
i found where i belong. i found my people.",0
"This may seem like a silly question but how do know what makes you happy? 

For a bit of background a big proportion of my late teens/early-mid 20s was very focused on a specific goal of making sure my siblings were looked after and I guess I kind of lost myself in doing that. 

I know that sunsets give me butterflies and I love getting lost in a good book but I donâ€™t have any hobbies or things in my life generally that make me happy. The thoughts of joining group situations with unknown people gives me a lot of anxiety so with that in mind how do I figure it out?",0
I told her I did like two ish weeks ago and have been giving her time to say it back. It's also the first time I've heard those words in about a decade.

"My acne is almost gone. Iâ€™ve taken good care of myself by working out at the gym. Iâ€™ve been giving it my all when I work out and Iâ€™m seeing progress! Iâ€™ve been doing school and working a full time job. Iâ€™ve kept my money up and my education. 

Iâ€™ve made myself a priority to me and it feels really good! Iâ€™ve also been finding what works for me in a sense of self expression and to cope with life. Iâ€™ve stopped making excuses for myself because of where Iâ€™ve come from in life. 

Iâ€™ve came to terms with my very bad past and have realized that I can make a better future for myself! Today after I get off of work I get to go to classes and make more progress on my education. 

Iâ€™ve been pushing myself really hard to get where I wanna be! Iâ€™m also thankful that I have the opportunity to better myself and my life. I have a lot of willpower and strength mentally which is what is helping me keep myself straight.",0
"She has been so nice to me lately! I really hope she isn't doing it because she feels like she has to... I was a little scared that she wouldn't want to be friends anymore when I told her I didn't know what I felt about her, but that she definitely made me happier than anyone else. At first it was a bit awkward but now it's okay. And she talks more to me, smiles more and does funny little things to make me smile. Today I was a bit stressed and sad and she hugged me. I felt immediately calmer and more optimistic and just so happy! I don't deserve her, she is the best person I have ever met! I hope we can be friends for a long time, I am so happy that I ever met her 

Hope people are having a good day and I hope everyone sleeps well tonight! Thanks for the patience to all the lovely strangers that let me rant, hope you can get a little smile from my happiness and hope you're doing well!",0
"i have been struggling with sharing my real emotions with people i love for many years. i will be completely honest with you. it still scares me. i still think they're gonna leave me and start hating me with no reason, but two days ago, i stepped out of my comfort zone for the very first time after my boyfriend told me he loves me. i knew i did a long time ago... when i could look through the things that hurt him, it hurt me too. when he was just happy about the success with his work, i was happy for him too, truly.

my heart still feels like it's gonna explode thinking about the moment i realized we've been feeling the same way. i was crying all night just thinking about it because i was too happy. it's really difficult for me to accept someone can just love me with no reason. i know, like people say, love can be a very irrational thing. maybe that's why i get so overwhelmed when i think of him.

i know. i'll always be wondering what he could want from someone like me and i'll get scared again, but i'm very slowly, v-e-r-y slowly learning how to accept the love and express my emotions to him. he's worthy. a little too worthy. he makes my heart so warm. he is the warmth i've never felt in this world before. i'm so happy to get to be around this precious human being.",0
"A friend of mine texted me today asking if I had exams on February 25. I replied I didn't and then she straight out told me not to make plans that night. She won't give anything away, but a Catalan band we love plays near town that day and we've been talking about it forever. She keeps saying I should consider it a birthday surprise and that she'll tell me about the actual details next week. I'm so blessed to have her in my life.

ps. I don't mean I'm blessed because she's giving it to me as a birthday gift. I mean I love being able to share our music taste and experiences like these :)",0
"My friend had a pretty severe fistula burst on her brain a year and half ago. She had 4% chance of regaining all her faculties but she is amazing. Well doctors have said she can drive again as she has recovered back to 98% of herself bar strength. She could lift 26kg before the fistula bleed, now she can just lift 15kg.
She re-insured her car, got it MOT and taxed (UK, England) and asked if I would be in the car with her for her first short trip/test drive. I went at 7:30 am before wok commute traffic started and she was very nervous. I've passed my driving test 4 years ago but asked her to drive to where I always did my practice pulling in and reversing my car into bays. She had said she was worried about this as her car isn't small and she was getting anxious. Luckily the carpark we went to was empty and she did many reverse and pull in maneuvers. She realized we had been doing this for nearly 2 hours driving round and said 'okay I think we should head home'. Then she looked up and the look of delight on her face when she seen a double rainbow was so lovely. It was very heart warming to see my friend gain her confidence back with driving, and that she asked me to be the one to help. She is 35+ years older than me and I am happy she found joy in a rainbow on her first day driving again.",0
"Iâ€™ve been feeling really awful, state of the world and everything, and thought â€œwhatâ€™s the point of finishing my degree if Iâ€™m gonna have to work for the rest of my life either way?â€ so I decided to put a pause on my degree and try my best to find a job that would at least make me less miserable than university has been making me feel for years. Iâ€™ve been in customer service and sales jobs that I hate all my life and itâ€™s made me feel so miserable and defeated. Nothing wrong with those but once youâ€™re experienced in those jobs itâ€™s hard to escape if you want to, especially with no office experience. 

I interviewed for an awesome position at this amazing place that I am super under-qualified for, was completely transparent that I hadnâ€™t finished my degree, went absolutely HAM preparing for the (multiple) interviews, and they sent me a job offer! It actually uses stuff from my degree! I donâ€™t have to interact with the public for it! Itâ€™s 100% optionally remote with an office a 15 minute walk from me I can go to work at if I need to get out of the house, and I can spend time at home with my partner and my cat if I want, and I just finally feel like things are starting to look up. I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m letting my partner down anymore (itâ€™s just an insecurity on my end, he really doesnâ€™t make me feel that way). We can move to some city thatâ€™s less expensive if we want! I can pay back my loans! I have HEALTH INSURANCE!! This could be a career for me! Iâ€™m so happy I could cry :)",0
Feeling quite bad at work. But one of the regular customer came in today and gave me a chocolate which really made me smile. He was an old man and I've only served him a couple of times.

"My mom is the most amazing person I know. Sheâ€™s been a rock for our family and specially for me through my life. She turns 60 on July 23rd of 2022. 

Now I have never been one for birthdays and gifts. I never celebrate my own so I have a hard time encapsulating what it means to many people. But. I want to make next year all about my mom, I want to make her smile every other day, I want the lead up to her big day to be filled with little bits of joy and I want her birthday to be amazing. 

I have no idea how to plan this our or execute it. I have no idea what gift I can offer her because all sheâ€™s ever wanted is for her son and daughter to succeed and be happy and she never asks for anything else.

"I never thought in all my years of composing that someone would take an interest in my music. The most people I've had perform my pieces is less than ten, and it was back in college at my senior recital.


To think that an excellent keyboardist, who has studied Baroque repertoire for his whole life chose *my* music makes me feel really humbled and very excited! I can play a few of my pieces but I'm far from a professional performer. Goodness, I'm far from a professional *composer* but overall this is really wonderful!

Someone took the time to learn my music, practice it, perfect it, and *perform* it. It's a lot of hard work, to learn, perfect, and record---so I can imagine how much time and effort went into the production. This really pleases me! I don't want to say that I'm too shocked for words because obviously this isn't true, but I'm just flabbergasted!",0

It took a long, long, LONG ass time to get to this point. I had a shitty childhood. I had mental health issues that got in the way of living my life. I relied on other peopleâ€™s validation and love to make me feel worthwhile. After a string of awful relationships and my dad dying, I took a step back and tried to work on myself. Donâ€™t get me wrong, it was hell in the beginning and I experienced my worst and possibly longest episode of depression during this time, but I stuck through it and with exercise, medication, and a whole lot of introspection, I finally feel like Iâ€™m done chasing after the idea of being happy and now Iâ€™m just living it :)",0
"At the beginning of 2021, my SO and I moved to his parent's house to stay for 10 months while we wait for the townhouse that we bought to finish building. 

It was a small house (2 bedroom, 1 bathroom), to fit 4 people all the time so i felt very uncomfortable, although they were very lovely people. Up until Oct 2021, I was having mention/emotional breakdowns every week due to having no privacy, freedom or space to do my own thing. 

Skip to now, Nov 2021, we have finished moved into our new build and I just feel immensely more happier! I can finally have space in the kitchen to cook, a decent lounge space to workout in, small backyard to do DIYs, and heaps of storage to hold my small business stock.

Growing up, my parents were divorced, I have been in legal trouble multiple times, I dropped out of high school, became addicted to sex, was homeless and pretty much followed the line everybody expected me to follow.

"Met a really kind guy a few weeks ago. At first because he lives in England &amp; I live in the US, I figured even a friendship wouldn't last too long but boyyyyy was I wrong

We talk all day, every day (sorta lol cuz ya know... Time zones ðŸ˜‚) whether it be texts, calls or voice messages. He's not at all a dry texter, he's great at keeping a conversation going which is great because I'm terrible at it! With him, there's always something to talk about and it's always a fun subject! 

We share stories about our friends, travels, childhoods, etc etc. We discuss what we still want to do, what we plan to do, etc. 

These past couple days, platonic story-telling and food critiquing has slowly turned into (obvious) flirting and teasing. ""Ayo, hope it's not to early to text you in the States rn"" has become ""Good morning baby girl, have any nice dreams?"" And I absolutely adore it. We still talk about silly little things such as what our favorite thing about ourself is, or what food we'd absolutely never try and why, etc, but we also have deep late-night chats. You know, the ones that make you feel heard and cared about. 

I know that this may very well just be some silly puppy-love that will fade over time... But I'm very much enjoying it while it lasts. And besides, I have a really, really good feeling about this. And my gut feeling has never failed me. Even if he's not my one &amp; only, I definitely think he's here for a long time and that's all that matters to me. :) &lt;3",0
"I (11m) have had a crush on my now girlfriend (10f) for about 6 years. A little bit of exposition: I was starting to get close with Alexandra, (Name changed) and there was some huge debate about who her crush was. She, being very popular, always had people asking. During one long walk at recess 64 days ago, I admitted to her that she was my crush. I, noticing her bright blush, asked her who her crush is. This is the following conversation:

A: His first name starts with an I and his last name starts with a B.

Me: You do know that I'm the only kid in the ENTIRE school who falls under that category, right?

A: Crap.

So based on this newfound knowledge of each other, we told her cousin, Kelsey (name changed) that I told A who my crush was. She wouldn't stop asking us. Eventually, the school day ends and it's time to go home. When she's at her mom's A goes to the church her Nana owns. I, knowing this, start my journey down there (I only live about 1500 feet away, or 457 meters). When I get there, I ask her if we can talk in private. Once we're alone, I ask her, ""Will you be my girlfriend?"" the way she stopped walking and stood there, surprised was so cute. Eventually, she says yes, and our relationship has been thriving ever since.

TL;DR: I had a crush on a girl who also had a crush on me, and when I asked her out she said yes.",0
"I would say that Iâ€™m a happier than average person.

Yesterday, I was watching this documentary when I realised I had been smiling the whole time. I know I smile a lot already. I tried to relax my face, it felt odd. Then I tried to frown, I didnâ€™t know how. So I went into the bathroom and tried to frown in the mirror, I struggled for a before working it out. Itâ€™s quite uncomfortable. Until then I had not noticed that I couldnâ€™t properly.
I reflected for a bit and kept on smiling. 

I like being me.

I actually think I smile so much that my face is deformed from it, I have a very short philtrum and my incisor teeth are pushed backward. Not sure if I care.",0

I have begun therapy to work on my deeper issues and toxic habits, but I am actually becoming a whole and complete person who takes pride in themselves and their life!",0

"She asked me today what I enjoyed the most. I thought about it, and said that I really loved the foam pit. It was super fun to dive down into the foam and so all sorts of crazy stunts. Naturally I asked her back -
what did she enjoy most about going to the trampoline park? 

She said, without even thinking, that the best part was to be with me. Needless to say, that made me so happy. She's 7 and she's just so wise sometimes. I love her so much and I wanted to share this, going to tell the wife tomorrow when she wakes up. Having kids can be so hard, but these things makes it worth it. I'm so proud of her â™¥ï¸",0
"For context, my wife has been struggling with an eating disorder for about a year now. The kitchen, food, and the whole 9 yards gives them severe anxiety. Well last night, my best friend whom I've never gotten to meet in person surprised me and visited to cook us dinner (he drove 3 hours and loves to cook for his friends). My wife, who set all of this up without me knowing, knew he was going to cook and kind of took the hit because it was supposed to be a birthday present. Well I kid you not, while he was in our kitchen, my wife went from nervous to incredibly excited. Yall its some of the best food I've ever tasted in my life.

I want to be able to do that for them. My wife had no issues all night after they got a taste of the food. I want to be able to cook like that, because frankly I never quite had either the funds or the desire to become a chef, and watching my wife overcome one of their biggest hurdles and actually enjoy themselves around food because of how good it was and how special it was....that makes me want to be able to give that to them.

So does anyone have any recipes they want to share? I finally have the funds to be able to cook and the desire kicked into place last night as well. If I can make my wife that happy around food every night I would cry.",0

"SO! I want to share something that I'm ecstatic for! Little background first: so when I was 18 i was diagnosed with a medical condition called kleinfelters syndrome. I joke about it now, but it was shitty at first. Some side effects of it are infertility, low testosterone levels, I can grow boobies when I get older, develop bone marrow cancer (more serious), micro dick, amongst other shitty things. However, low test and infertility is all I have been dealing with so dodged a bullet with the other stuff. I got a lil swimmer saved at the sperm bank for when I want to have kids, 450 a year in child support.. shit head. Anyways, I get blood work done to see what my test levels are. From 20 to 22 I was on 250mg of test every 23 days but I was real shitty with staying on top of it. I wouldn't take it the day I was supposed to or would miss a month or so. When I actually took it consecutively I was on fire. Libido was on point, mood swings chilled out, I wasn't so exhausted all the time. Unfortunately, at that time, I was in a very abusive relationship and when shit finally hit rock bottom taking care of myself was a serious struggle and I stopped any trt or just taking care of me, ya know? For awhile too, but when I went to the docs to get some bloodwork looked at they said my levels were good so I didn't worry about it again until this year. I'm 24 now and I started to notice low levels from daily interactions. It started slow, like, once a week or once every couple of weeks. I would get emotional over dumb ass things like im watching a show or a commercial and something remotely sad, happy, happens, or I'm talking to friends, I could pressure build up behind my eyes like I was gonna cry. It would be random. I would have frequent mood swings and be tired 24/7 no matter the amount of sleep I'd get. Kiss sex goodbye, I like sex who doesn't? On test I was goin 3- 4 times a day. Now, once a week is about is enough and half the time dick doesn't function how it should. It's fucking aggravating being 24 and your insides not working ya know? Or your sex drive being in the gutter.. So, rewind to last month. I go get new bloodwork done and find out my levels are low. I knew this already, now I work in the oilfield so getting back on shots asap isn't the easiest cause I'm gone 2/3rds of the month. So I started looking into gettin on test more frequently than prescribed. I have a trusted source (doctor) I can aquire pharmaceutical grade testosterone from. Now I'm on 250mg shots once a week and I just did my first last week. I'm stoked, idc if I'm on ""gear"" working out. It's hard af building muscle when your natural levels are in the ground. I'm so ready to not be exhausted every day, feel like imma break down in tears, have a shitty sex drive, etc! My energy is already up, im so pumped to get after shit now. I'm tired of feelin like garbage all the time. I'm out of toxic bs, got my head on straight, got a vision and drive, and gettin my levels back up I feel like im on top of the fucking world. I haven't felt this good in a long time and I'm so stoked to see what's to come in the future! I'm away from a shitty ass human and healed from all that bs, I got a good new career going on in the oilfield, good friends that push me, bridges i burned with my family I have repaired and are closer than ever, but most importantly I'm seriously taking care of myself on all levels now and I couldn't be happier with myself atm!",0

"\[ preface: I used gift bags, and I wore masks and gloves to hand them out! We were as safe as could be! \]

I don't think I've ever has such a fun experience in my life. So many cute costumes. So many happy kids. So many happy adults! I let the kids take a gift bag each and they all seemed so excitedâ€”not to mention when I would recognize costumes and characters, even a few that people normally wouldn't (like certain video game and anime characters). I hope I made their day as much as mine was made when people recognized my out-there outfits as a kid and teen.

I even dressed up (after telling myself I wouldn't because I felt like crap), said hi (from afar) to adorable babies dressed in adorable little costumes, and gave out small, simple treat bags for the dogs that accompanied the adults; even a couple service dogs! I of course asked the owners, but they were 100% okay with it and actually seemed quite happy that they got to take one home.

To those who came to my house this year, thank you. I thanked you guys during, and I'm thanking you now. My week has been utter shit and this was just... I'm elated. I'm doing this again so long as Halloween is on for the rest of forever.

This has me stimming I'm so overjoyed! 

I just had to share it with someone, since I know other adults who have done this probably aren't really this excited about it, and who knows, maybe Reddit won't be either, but, I am so so so so happy!

Back story:
Sam started losing his hair in his late twenties just like me. I made my peace with the hair loss and shaved it all off, but he hasnâ€™t been able to do that because he doesnâ€™t think the bald look suits him. Anyways, he started looking at options and toupees made most sense. He loves to wear hats and hence wanted something that he can attach without much effort on his part. Since a hair system takes only a few minutes for application, they suited his goals perfectly. He considered surgery too but the risk of side effects and massive cost put him off. Looking at him, Iâ€™m actually considering more the idea of buying a hair toupee. I spoke to my girlfriend and sheâ€™s in fact quite supportive about it. Sam says Lordhair comes up with amazing discounts on festive occasions like Halloween and Black Friday. Maybe, Iâ€™ll buy one too! What do you guys think about toupees or wigs? Know any other supplier that has great products with real hair? I want some nice deals.",0
"A little about me. Im a Marine Veteran, Disabled (PTSD, ADHD, Insomnia, Severe RA ""rheumatoid arthritis), I started streaming full time on twitch about 13 months ago (things are going good, i made partner). I mostly started streaming to find people to hang out with and play video games with. Possibly open up and talk about my Mental health struggles. So far its been going great and ive met a lot of amazing people along the way. Including here on reddit via another post i made about when i was stuck awake for about 130hrs and streamed 103 of those hours.
BUTTTT, enough about me. This post is about another amazing human ive met through streaming. His name Is Wagnus. He has streamed every day for the last 600 days. Not once missed a single day. One day i was near the end of a pretty bad insomnia bout and Wagnus and Mzsweetdevil another streamer raided me while i was 55hours into stream playing apex. they tried to get my attention as they wanted to play with me but i was in the zone. After stream i reached out to them and thanked them and i found out about all the wag does for his community. Hes a champion for other people. Nearly every stream he makes it a point to spend large amounts of time asking other people who their streams and lives are going. Asking people to post their clips and genuinely just wants to make sure everyone else is doing okay. Once i found out what he stands for and what he does for others mental health and just being the ear for someone to vent to when he could just do what everyone else does on twitch, and also finding out about how rough he has had it over the last 2 years and not once has personal life struggles stopped him from showing up for his community and the people who wander by it. I knew that i owed it to my late brother to lift this amazing human up as high as i could. He is everything i want to be, Hes someone that everyone should speak to at least once. Hes so Kind, Funny, and brave. Hes an amazing dog dad To the Adorbs ADA. He was becoming down and depressed with not already having reached partner and becoming more financially stable. So i did the only thing i know how to do.
I Assembled the Fluffy Legion. I reached out to his close friends. Once i became partner my self i told him that i will be bringing him with me. I have to, I owe it to my brother who passed away at 34 from addiction related issues and a heart attack. This human and many others are worth it.
So i started planning and asking around. I got wind he has trouble with streams sometimes using the same pc for streaming and gaming. So i built him a streaming pc [https://twitter.com/crypto\_wrench/status/1452633228980985866](https://twitter.com/crypto_wrench/status/1452633228980985866)
Then we as a huge family threw all the financial support at him we could. All that is left is to help him reach as many humans as possible.
Im bad with words, My ADHD doesnt help. The point is. Give this human a chance. Hes wonderful and amazing. You can find him here every day like clock work at or near 11pm-12 [https://www.twitch.tv/wagnus](https://www.twitch.tv/wagnus)

"If you look at my post history, even for a few seconds, youâ€™ll notice that I really like to talk about what I like to call the Coleâ€™s Girlfriend Saga.
If you want to read about it, hereâ€™s my original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/n3zgmd/im_so_damn_sick_and_tired_of_getting_duped_by/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
If not, allow me to summarize: Prior to 2021, my main group of friends consisted of Me, Jack, Cole, and Gage. Then Cole got a girlfriend. Then Coleâ€™s girlfriend wanted total control over the group, and staged a dispute between us regarding our mutual suicidalness in an (successful) attempt to turn my buddies against me. New Yearâ€™s Eve, I was exiled from the group, a new group chat was made without out me, and I was left to rot in a state of perpetual suicidalness for the next few months. Cole did not care what happened to me because he thought he would get laid. He did not get laid. He got dumped. He came back to me shortly after to try and get me to be his friend again. I rejected his half-assed apology. He roasted me, officially ended the friendship, and would continue to harass me for the next month for not getting over it. I havenâ€™t spoken a word in our group chat since 2020.
Now that youâ€™re all caught up, things might possibly be about to change. Iâ€™ve not been feeling well lately, so I took off the first few classes of the school day to go to the Doctor. By the time I got to school, it was Lunch Break. As Iâ€™m walking up to Jack in the lunch line, I hear Cole say to him, â€œYou ever wish you could be friends with somebody again, but you fucked it all up?â€ I canâ€™t prove that heâ€™s talking about me, but if he is, thatâ€™s incredible, because keep in mind the last time I texted him he was boldly refusing to accept any responsibility for what happened. Itâ€™s good to know that he could finally be coming to his senses almost a year later.",0

I went into work this morning after having a shave and for the time I've worked there I've always had a bushy beard but I decided to trim it down. Anyway I went into work this morning after having a shave and a girl I work with told me I looked good and like I'd lost weight! It literally put me in the best mood and then later on in the day a customer told me I was in amongst the politest people he's ever been served by and he was so happy to have had me serving him. My day literally can't get better,0
"As the title says iv been unemployed for a while, iv been doing applications every day and just slamming my face into the wall with no luck, debt climbing, barely scraping by on my rent, barely enough money for food...i was not in a good place. Well over the past week i have gotten 4 job offers for employment, all of them are on average 20-25k more per year than my previous job. I was looking through the offers and i ultimately decided to accept the 2nd highest per year option. Mainly because it was a full remote position instead of a 1 hour commute each way, and way better benefits. I just feel like a weight has been lifted and my depression funk is starting to go away where i can start to actually see myself thriving instead of just barely surviving.",0
"SO excited!
So my entire life, I have been an outcast. I always invited people to do stuff but no one ever followed through.

"I had a falling out with some good friends a few months ago that had really made an impact on me. Since then Iâ€™ve felt insecure and self-conscious, like Iâ€™m lame and have no friends (even though I do). Tonight I decided to finally make peace with it and start to move on. I messaged one of them and we both made clear that we have no ill feelings toward each other and wished each other the best. 
I finally am realizing that I do not need to beat myself up over this anymore. Forgiveness is such a part of self-love, toward other people but most importantly yourself. Losing friends and gaining friends is just a part of life. Everybody goes through it. Life is short but itâ€™s also so long. It feels enlightening to be reaching this other side of grief.",0

"I collect Polish medals from World War II. I got my first big bulk of my collection from an estate sale, but I have been slowly collecting them on eBay over the years. Several years ago, I came across a really neat set of the 1939-1945 Star (with the miniature uniform medal), the Italian Star, and documentation from the Polish government in exile awarding them to the veteran with name, date of birth, etc. It was a complete set. Maybe 6-7 years ago, I posted on some random military history message board asking if they could look the veteran up by name to see if they had any type of history on him, so maybe I could learn his story. I found out some basic information about his service and demographic information like his parents names and where he was born, and that's it. I carefully stored them in my collection and looked at them every so often.
Earlier this year, I got emails notifying me of private messages on that message board that I haven't thought about in years. Someone claiming to be the granddaughter of the veteran, and that their grandmother (veteran's wife) was researching his name online and found that I had his medals here in the United States. I thought it was a scam, but I provided them with my email. They were able to send me verification that they were in fact the family of the veteran. They were asking to buy the medals back from me, I told them that I'll give them the medals back in exchange for just telling me his story, which they did. They even sent me a few copies of his handwritten notes from the war, and copies of photographs from before, during, and after the war.
The medals finally found their way home, and they sent me a picture of the widow with [her husband's medals](https://i.imgur.com/DWt2v2Q.jpg). This is such an unbelievable story, I am thankful to have been part of this. We still don't know how the medals ended up here in the United States.",0

"It was from the belongings of my late grandmother, my aunts and my mom were recently beginning to sort things out and each brought home a large box of clothes, yesterday we went through them to see what might fit me and what I could still use. And in there was this large wool vest, that was handmade and very likely by my grandma herself, and I first put it to the side, but then I got cold and put it on, and I haven't taken it off since (I was already in pajamas, lol). It is so nice, it keeps warm in all the right places, my shoulders, my core, my hips, it has a really nice weight to it but doesn't get heavy, I can wrap it around to conform to my my body but it doesn't get in the way, it still lets air through, it is just great. And it looks really nice, too! I love you grandma.",0

"I can't describe how I feel right now, but I think this is the happiest I've ever felt!

Since we're both a bit shy, we ended up confessing to eachother through music!

On my to visit home yesterday, I sent him a song that reminded me of him, and last night, as we were saying goodnight he sent me Beautiful brain by Mabel Ye and told me it reminded him of me! I listened to and realised but was still unsure and nervous, so this morning I sent him Day 1 by Honne as a reply and after listening to it he told me that he has a crush on me!

We met a month ago, which is quick I know, but we've been living as university flatmates.
As soon as we started hanging out, I started to feel something for him, and despite only knowing him for a short while - he's amazing and wonderful and so kind!

We bake together and he makes me dinner, he spoon fed me some while I was washing up,
He listens to Christmas songs with me while baking just because they make us happy,
We have so much in common and so many differences at the same time! But I feel like I've learnt so many new things from him,
When he felt a drop of rain while we were walking, he pulled my hood for me without a word,
He let's me cuddle into him while watching movies and does the same to me - when I fell asleep on his shoulder he didn't move at all,
One of my flatmates started getting mad at me for something, but he stood up for me and defended me!

We talk everyday, and even when we're not physically together, we always text eachother!
He's made me feel more safe, comfortable and happy than anyone ever has!

He's typing right now, so I'll have to leave this here! We're just two shy people that like each other a lot!",0

"For my whole life, Iâ€™ve always had big dreams and aspirations; one of those dreams was always to go to an exceptional school and continue the hard work I put in all of high school. From the first time I ever stepped foot on this campus, I immediately felt like I had found a new home - a place where I'd foster professional and social relationships to last a lifetime, where I'd prepare myself for life beyond college, and where I'd grow as an individual. As I sit here 3 and a half years later, with the end in sight, I find myself reflecting on these expectations and believe that I've lived that out to its full extent. I've had good times and bad, I've made mistakes and had big successes, and I've experienced happiness and sadness. In the end though, I grew with each experience and believe that when graduation comes along in June, I will look back on my time here, content with everything I gave and everything that this school gave me. I expected this school to be a place I'd love but at the end of the day I found it to be a place I loved that loved me back and gave me everything it could.",0
"I went to the eye doctor about a month ago hoping to get contact lenses. Thereâ€™s a â€œclassâ€ you have to go through to get them. They want you to fit the lens in your eye and be able to remove them before they approve you for contacts. Make sure they are in your eye correctly, and you donâ€™t damage your eye taking them out. I spent an hour last month trying to get one in and I couldnâ€™t do it. My blink reflex is too strong. I got frustrated and just settled for glasses.

I really didnâ€™t want glasses again. I got hit in the face at work and mine broke and were being held together with tape and epoxy. Iâ€™m tired of them getting dirty, then trying to clean them on the spot and having to deal with either new scratches or smudges and still not being able to see. I hate the Sun being in my eyes coming home from work in the morning and not being able to wear sunglasses unless I paid $400-$600 for a name brand prescription pair. Iâ€™m tired of frames being in my field of vision and having to move my head more to see correctly. I really wanted to get away from glasses.

Few hours later after the disappointment wore off I called and made an appointment again for a month later to try again. That leads to today and I was able to get them in this time. And it was amazing. I could see actually better than I could with my new glasses. I didnâ€™t have frames in the way. I didnâ€™t have specks of dust to look through. Everything was actually clear. Without glasses. I couldnâ€™t stop smiling. It was amazing being able to see without glasses. Being able to actually scratch beside my eye whereas before Iâ€™d have to be mindful of my glasses to not touch them and put a mark on them and make that spot blurry. I just couldnâ€™t stop smiling. Iâ€™m still smiling. I havenâ€™t been able to see without glasses this clearly since I was a child. Itâ€™s just an amazing feeling to me. I donâ€™t really have anyone to share this with but I wanted to share with someone. Iâ€™m so happy I donâ€™t have to deal with glasses as much anymore.",0
"I don't usually write here so apologies for any mistakes. I (20F) am a college student. I still live with my parents and that's normal here. I had a lot of free time during the mid-sem break so I decided to apply for a job. During the interview, I told them I am a college student and they were generous enough to provide me the flexibility to study and work at the same time. The salary is more than enough for me, considering I don't spend much apart from food and Spotify. I was really happy about it and I decided to keep it to myself for a while. I didn't tell anyone in my family about it. I was waiting to tell them about it after I get them a gift or something. So today my mom was complaining about her health. She has thyroid and pcos and lately, she has been complaining about headaches. I made an appointment for her and booked a routine checkup for her.

Ruth searched her belongings for the forgotten rings in a scramble and found two of the three lost rings. The most meaningful ring, her diamond wedding band, was missing. Ruth contacted me, and we were able to meet on the beach later that day. Within a few minutes of searching the sand for the lost ring with my metal detector, Ruthâ€™s ring was back on her finger!

"(First and foremost, I'm not here to promote anything, I will not be giving the handle out to anyone, even if asked, just so that we're clear. I only want to share the joyful and sentimental feelings I'm currently in right now.)
My puppies have their own TikTok page and have been a part of Tik Tok since they were 5 weeks old. They were the tiniest beans we've had. I look through their old videos from time to time and was doing so today. I ended up on one of their last videos and it was a video of them first as 5 week old puppies and then as they look today, at 10 months. The song was ""night changes"" by One Direction. I cried, thinking about how much the three of us have been through together, how much time I put into their needs and the moments where I'd hold their tiny bodies in my arms and they'd fall asleep.
There's a part in the song that says, ""We're only getting older baby, and I've been thinking about it lately, does it ever drive you crazy, just how fast the night changes?"" And it makes me think about how quickly they grew up and how little time I unknowingly had to hold them in my arms. It doesn't make me sad, not one bit, but I do wish I had more tome to hold them, even though I was doing it a lot already. It'll always be my favorite memory with them. I love my puppies so much and wouldn't trade them for the world.",0

"I went to a vacation far away I payed for erotic &amp; fuck massage. But i just got normal decent body massage without any erotic or sexual acts.

Those 2 hot girls around my age told i look Hot. Obviously i didn't believe it.

Those 2 girls told me at end of massage i paid twice the normal price &amp; got cheated by the broker as i won't receive any sexual favors.

I tried looking for him. He was no where to be found. 

Then i got back to the massage parlor and asked those girls if i really looked hot. Then they said yes, still didn't believe it.

I left the room &amp; waited outside the room girls thought i left after 20 seconds average looking girl asked hot looking girl didn't he looked a little hot.

Reason I'm so happy that i just wash my face while bath thats it. I don't apply any face creams or hair creams etc i didn't put any effort for look.

Even then i looked a little hot for a girl. If i put effort i can look hot.",0

"If you were given the choice: to have absolute, heartfelt joy, or experience the complete pleasures of the world. 

For worldly pleasures you can have mansions and yachts and hot girls/guys. Lots of expensive gifts and objects. You can fly in private jets and go on vacations to the most exotic places- eating the best food. (not to mention lots and lots of money, power and status)

For true joy, imagine this: A modest house in a small town, with your soulmate, with your ride or die best friends as your neighbors, having a family and getting drunk with your friends at a local bar, breaking rules (not serious ones, just little ones for fun), etc. You live with nature as the woods in your backyard and have all the cute pets and friends your heart desires. Imagine all the blissful, innocent, pure joys your heart desires.

"I finally had the good fortune of meeting a good man that loves me for real. Weâ€™ve been together a while now. His son is a sweetheart, he opens up to me about his troubles and thoughts and heâ€™s the man of the house for me when dad is working his two jobs. He gives me a reason to be a kid again (which I never grew out of anyway ðŸ˜…). I had to tell somebody. I love our little life. We are broke as shit and thriving in a tiny apartment. We carved pumpkins and did arts and crafts last week. There are pumpkin seeds and glitter and toys everywhere. I have a bag of lollipops hidden behind my nightstand for special treats, he doesnâ€™t know and thinks I only bought the one I gave him. I always loved to sing and my boyfriend is the first person I could ever freely sing in front of without feeling self conscious. We have pretty house plants, and his son picked me beautiful flowers from the backyard that melted my heart. Reddit, I just had to tell somebody that my little tiny life with my boys is wonderful.

"Hey everyone,

I send out handwritten random cards of positivity to anyone who wants some love and happiness in the mail. 

It includes various little bits such as stickers, notelets, colouring sheets, wordsearches, positive affirmation cards, quotes and more.

Writing the cards is quite therapeutic for me and helps with my own anxiety and calms me so that's always another reason I enjoy doing it. (over 170 sent so far! - I have a mission to send 1,000 by September next year!) 

If you want to join my mission on spreading positivity, happiness, and love through small acts of kindness I do have a patreon you can get some lovely benefits along side paying to forward for someone else to receive some positivity in the post.

"I work in a permanent WFH job that had a lot of challenges over the past year and a half. I put up with a lot of broken promises (like raises that never came) and being pushed onto people's back burners. I had to use the little savings I had to keep my family from going broke. Paying for insurance alone almost destroyed me -- it cost 45% of my net income and the deductible was so high that my family would've gone broke long before coverage would kick in. I personally hit an all-time-low with my mental and physical health at the beginning of the summer, and I've been trying to pull myself back up mostly on my own. I've gained 30 pounds in 4 months. 

I didn't realize how much of it was because of work until I said my final goodbyes to my teammates a few minutes ago. Everything just lifted off of me. I'm sitting straighter and breathing better. I swear, a pain I had in my lower back is gone. Today is a big deal.

My wife asked me if I was okay a little bit ago and I told her yeah, I was just smiling. She said she asked because she can't remember the last time she saw me smile on a weekday. 

I'm now uninstalling all of the company software and profiles from my personal computer. It feels incredible to have my home back. I'm gonna play some Final Fantasy Tactics and keep this feel-good train chuggin'. 

I hope you're all having a day this good -- here's to endings!",0

"Ok so for context I recently started a relationship (3 weeks) with my crush and we havenâ€™t been able to meet much since neither of us have a car and they live pretty far away. Today we went on a date to the movie theater (we were watching Dear Evan Hansen) to see each other and we kissed. We had kissed before but it was really brief when they were leaving a party at a friendâ€™s house. So I ended up spending like 20 minutes just kissing them. And when I say kissed I mean we really kissed. I wonâ€™t go into details because tmi but I will say there was only one person in our row on the complete other side who was probably a Karen by the way she looked at us. I could keep talking about this but on the movie, it was really good would recommend. But yeah Iâ€™m just so fucking happy rn.

TL;DR went to the movies and kissed my partner for like 20 minutes and Iâ€™m happy",0
"Having rented my entire adult life, every time I've needed to take the trash out, aside from one place, that's always meant loading up my car and driving over to the dumpster. Not a huge deal, but also something you don't want to do constantly. So, once or twice a week, I'd have to gather up all the trash in my house, which I'd procrastinate on until the trash cans were practically overflowing or starting to smell, put on shoes, haul usually 4-5 trash bags and assorted boxes to the car, then drive over and unload.

Now, at my house, when a can is full, I can just take that one bag, carry it to my garage, and toss it in the bigger can. Or, if I have a box or something to large for the indoor can, just carry it over to the garage and toss it in. Also, I can finally recycle, which I've never been able to do (without a herculean amount of effort of hauling it a not insignificant distance to the recycling center myself).

Sure, I have to haul it to the curb once a week, but that's a small price to pay.",0
"I'm so glad to be myself again. I've suffered from depression and suicidal thoughts for almost a year now. I lost a lot my selfworth and that faithful day October 8th, 2021.

It was halftime at the football game we got out there and got set up, they called out the Marchers of the Week, I didn't hear my name in there so I cast it aside, then after the show after we did the school fight song. Whilst we were toward the football players' inflatable entrance they called the marchers of the week, and I heard it: My name!. I was jumping up and down and got into line with the rest of the band. Once we got back in the stands, I then cried I was so happy. I told people that I got it and got multiple hugs. Sorry for rambling",0

"I remember being told by my high-school guidance counselor that college wasnâ€™t even an option for me. I used to harbor so much anger and be a trouble maker. Financial instability was always a thing growing up. Itâ€™s just how I thought the world was for me.

Iâ€™ve had an amazing hiring experience and never thought Iâ€™d make it past the resume part. Iâ€™m the first in my family to ever go to college. I survived through athletic scholarships and so many awful, random jobs.
This December Iâ€™ll be receiving both an MBA and MPAcc. I have worked so hard for so many years to get here. This was always my dream, as in literally, I would joke about wanting to be in this position because I thought it was so out of reach. It still doesnâ€™t seem real and honestly not sure how to express my excitement because Iâ€™ve been working so hard towards this for so long. I donâ€™t really have a support system to express my excitement so Iâ€™m ranting here. Idk how to express my excitement outward without feeling like Iâ€™m bragging. Statistically, thereâ€™s no reason i should have reached this point and am just really proud of myself honestly. I hope I am able to provide proof to my two younger brothers that they can achieve anything they want. College wasnâ€™t even a possible option for us. I hope I can give back to others and be the person who Iâ€™ve always needed and searched for.",0

I had to fight for every raise I got, and the last 3 years went without a single promption. I quit due to being undervalued and they told me it would take them 2 years to pay me I deserved. Instead I bounced and found an employer who gave me a nearly 40% increase in just 6 months of working there.

"Here is one philosophical question he answered! In the Nicomachean Ethics - the book got its name because it was edited by his
son, Nicomachus - Aristotle set himself the task of identifying the factors that
lead people to have a good life, or not. He suggested that good and successful
people all possess distinct virtues, and proposed that we should get better at
identifying what these are, so that we can nurture them in ourselves and honour them in others ! What are friends for ? He identifies three different kinds of friendship :thereâ€™s friendship that comes about when each person is seeking fun thereâ€™s a chief interest is in their own pleasure and the opportunity of the moment which the other person provides . Then there are friendships that are really strategic acquaintances where people take pleasure in each others company only in so far as they have hopes of taking advantage of it. Then thereâ€™s the true friend not someone just like you but someone who is seeing you but about who you care as much as you care about yourself the sorrows of your true friend are you sorrows . their joys are yours . It makes you more vulnerable should anything before this person but itâ€™s hugely strengthening too . Friendship teaches us what we ought to be itâ€™s quite literally the best part of life .",0

"Personally I enjoy music more when i can relate with the subject sang/played about. It allows me to sing along without feeling ashamed. For example I wouldn't be able to sing along with most commercial music since a lot of it is about partying and being horny in da club and such.

"Hey guys just want to share my story. I am almost 30 years old. Ever since I could remember I've always been depressed, sad, and angry, even as a kid. Got into alcohol, weed, and a lot of sex with random women that I had no desire to be with long term. To keep it simple, and short, I've eliminated the first two and have been sober for two years. I still find my self meeting new women all the time but I try and be conscious of it because it seems like I use sex as a means of coping with depression, anger and sadness. I meditate every day now and that has helped quite a bit. I stay active, on a good diet, and take vitamin d3 and creatine everyday, both have shown to help with feeling better. As a result of all this I am sleeping better at night which has created a dominoe effect on the rest of my life. The more recovered I am the stronger mindset I have to take on a new day.

Please don't ever give up. I am starting to realize that life is a process that needs daily maintenance. Don't rush through anything, develop a plan, enjoy each step, and make adjustments here and there when needed. You don't need drugs or other people. All you need is within. Although google and the internet have almost been a god send with connecting with other people, hearing their stories, and finding articles that are science based that gives me a better idea of what and what not to look for whether it's diet, behaviors, exercises, how to sleep better. All that plays a part. It's just a big puzzle, and I hope each and everyone of you has fun solving it because I truly believe that's what life is about.

Peace",0
"**The student I mentored in a scientific research field which I wanted to pursue achieved the goals I'll never be able to do.**

One time, I brought a college kid who resembled the skills and characteristics I had as an undergraduate back then to our country's top university research lab I used to worked at as a researcher. I knew him through a career help subreddit. He became an intern to the project I was working on. A bit of background, I originally wanted to become a full-pledged scientist with the Ph.D and a research career but unfortunately I had to become a family breadwinner at an early age so I quit and got into tech corporate for the money. I left this college kid and I can still remember how he felt so nervous that he might not be as smart as the people in our lab as he came from a country-side university. I assured him that the people there are nice and will never look down upon him. I used to study from a country-side university too so I understood how he must have felt.

Six months later, corporate tech is uninspiring and everyday lately felt like I'm losing my soul and motivation in life. Only good thing is I am paid 3x more now which goes into student loans and family debt. Then, today this student sent me an email that he got into a prestigious research lab in Europe! He'll do another internship there and after he graduates he will pursue higher studies on the same EU lab!!! We're from a third world country so this is really great news. He sent me an expensive gift(he is from a well-off family) as a way of saying thank you for the opportunity. I never expected anything! I am overjoyed that someone who resembles so much of my younger self is pursuing the dreams and goals I abandoned. \*relaxed emoji\*",0

**Background.**
So a little background on myself, I'm obviously not going to get into the whole detail for detail story of my life in order to not bring down anyone who's reading this and having a lovely day but here is the basics. When I was born, I had some complications at birth causing me to have a stroke down the entire left side of my body. the moment I was born, I received PT/OT which lasted until I was probably 10 or 11. Around that time, My family moved to a completely different part of the country. When I got into the new school district, I did not participate in physical therapy because I was scared of being made fun of. Which everyone did regardless. Fast forward a few years and I'm in Highschool now, I've been through a lot. I was a rather self loathing person at that point in my life. I lost my best friend, my brother, to college at that point and was not feeling life at all. I was depressed. I began praying an awful lot idk why, for love, for friends, for anything really. One day, sitting last year in my virtual class I decided I was done hating myself for no reason.
**I wanted to change.**
I had always been a smart kid; AP courses and whatnot so I always relied on my brain to get me through anything but now I wanted it all baby! I wanted everything. **I wanted to be someone, someone I was proud of.** I got done with my boring elective course and lingered over to the garage and started lifting the 5 pound weights sitting on the desk. I learned two things that day: Lifting weights is fun and most importantly it's incredible hard. **Growth.**
Finding myself increasingly bored with videogames and installing Arch Linux for the 10th time, Weightlifting became this wonderful new outlet for my life. I started doing every exercise I could because it became so enjoyable to me. I also noticed another thing: I was able to do things with my hands and move my fingers in ways I never even knew I could ever do. I went 5 to 10, 10 to 20, 20 to 30, 30 to 40, 40 to 50 and growing every week. My weight lifting had given my an entirely different approach to every aspect of my life. I was finally beginning to be happy with life. **On clown nine**
It's my senior year now**.** I am a college student through my Highschool, I show up to a class at the Highschool then I go to the college for two classes sometime during the week. I have a group of friends who I talk to for like 50 minutes after class before heading home and a friend I can text whenever to hang out with. GOD has blessed me so gratefully by placing a wonderful girlfriend in my life who has helped me become so so so much more of a better man and a happier person. I work hard for myself and I pay it back to those who have supported me along the way. about an hour ago, I did 5 reps for 200 pounds. Something that just broke me, making me so grateful about life. I have come so far through so many hardships and I've reached the top. I fly airplanes now, Left handed. I drive, left handed. I partially wrote this, left handed. I am rarely home, hanging with friends making up the time I've lost over the past few years. **Closing**
I am so grateful for life now, I live the life I always thought was impossible for me. I'm getting college applications from colleges I never even dreamed I could ever attend. I am humbled by the beautiful things in life. I don't seek pity or attention, I am confident with myself and I don't need anyone to validate me. I humbled by the wonderful things that have happened to me and wish the best for everyone. To those in a position like me, afraid nothing ever changes, you need to give yourself the chance of a lifetime and be proud of who you are and push yourself to overcome obstacles in your life!
**Closing the closing**
I may have strength and courage now, but I will always be a nerd at heart. I hope anyone who reads this has an amazing day! I'll be around from time to time to answer questions &amp; whatnot if anyone has any.",0

Iâ€™m 17 and I have a huge fear of needles plus my mom is anti vaxx but I went in secret to the clinic today and I got my first dose! Iâ€™m so proud of myself because I had to go alone and I hate needles. Proud to be taking care of my country one Jab at a time !",0
"Today I...:

I've received money from the government. Lol

Met a really nice old man in the metro. He was so helpful. 

I bought new books.

I sold my guitar hence money. 

I GOT HIRED FOR THE FIRST TIME. 

I am so happy everyone. I've been jobless and broke for 4 years. I am happy thank you universe. Thank you. 

I hope I do well in my job. I hope I could keep up. I hope. I hope. I hope. But right now I am so happy. 

Thank you for listening reddit. I feel so full and optimistic. Thank you. I don't know who you are but thank you for listening. And I hope you have/had a good day too.

Oh and I bought some clothes for my dog too.I feel so fucking lucky right now. Maybe I should buy a lotto ticket lol",0
"Although I know I'm not overbearing, I sometimes just feel so in love with him that it's the best way visually for me to describe it.

Our 2 year dating anniversary is November 19th and we couldn't be happier.

It's crazy how much one can appreciate when things are going so right after dealing with toxic relationships in one's past. The fact that we've both been through very similar experiences in this regard just enhances what we have with each other now.

We're so on cloud 9 together and it's AMAZING.",0
"Haven't seen my father in a month, I was really missing him. So over the weekend he surprised me by driving 250 km to visit me! We went to zoo, we've eaten great chocolate cake, I made him pasta I found online. It was too spicy for both of us so we ended up crying and laughing at the same time while drinking milk after eating it all. We've watched Interstellar (our favourite movie). On Sunday he helped me to repot my plants and I took him to see a retro car exhibition. He really enjoyed it! My dad is the best parent ever, I'm grateful for him every day.",0
"I'm so fucking stoked right now!

Today I went out with a girl I met online, and I was so nervous and thought I fucking blew it; I literally was 97% convinced there is no chance she would ever want to see me again. I texted her a few hours later though and she said she had fun, and would actually like to go out again!! As someone who has literally never had a girlfriend, I am so excited right now and can't wait to see her more!

I know I have to keep my expectations in check, and realize this is still just the early stages, but such a big step for me nonetheless! :D",0
"Iâ€™ve been a drummer and a music scene go-er ever since I was 10. 

From drinking Shirley temples and wearing headphones at shows with my Mom, to getting punched in the face outside of a punk venue for calling a guy a neo nazi. 

From my first band, an all girl feminist punk band called â€œpunch me prettyâ€ to my band now. 
My current fellow members are my best friends in the whole world, and make me feel so validated and supported especially as the only female musician under our ENTIRE label. 

Playing songs with them brings tears to my eyes at almost every show because of the strong sense of belonging I feel from them and the rest of our friend group. 

We just got signed last year and weâ€™re off to record next month. I canâ€™t fucking believe this. 

SO HAPPY!!!!",0
"I had a very long day yesterday, and I wasn't having a good time. I had done a ton of things which I'm proud of, but I was so tired, I just wanted a hug and sleep. 

When I was about to go to sleep I realised whatsapp wasn't working, but I thought I couldn't call my boyfriend to say goodnight because he was in school. Then he called me! He told me he knew I worked hard that day and would probably go to sleep early, but he wanted to say he loves me before I went to sleep, so he told the teacher he had to go to the bathroom, just to call me quickly. I had a really long day, and I didn't expect to hear from him anymore untill tomorrow, but there he was! He was so cute and kind :) 

It's morning now, and I woke up an hour ago, and I still feel happy thinking about it. He took time out of his lesson to call me to ask about my day and tell me he loves me. 

(For clarity: His school is in the evening, untill pretty late)",0
"I don't know if this is the right subreddit for this but I really wanted to tell someone lol. I had a math exam last week and I studied my ass off for it, but once I took the test itself I realized that I was only like 50% sure that my answers were right on every single problem. I've been stressed about it all weekend but I ended up getting a B! Not the best grade but it is LEAGUES above what I thought I would get. I really straight up thought I would have gotten every single problem wrong. It's my first exam in college too which stressed me out even more lol.",0
"I'm a humble laid back type of person, if something good happen to me I try my best to keep it to myself because I understand not everybody is fortunate at times but when I do tell someone the ""good news"" I feel as if I can sometimes tell when they are happen or when then aren't so happy for me.... How can you tell?",0
"ok so usually i post in r/anxiety and r/depression because i suffer from both of those things, but for some random reason i am SO happy and I can't for the life of me explain why. I'm off my medication, which usually sends me spiraling, but I'm doing great. I'm having the motivation to do stuff again. what the heck is going on?

maybe something really great is about to happen to me? i'm not sure. i welcome these positive feelings regardless.",0
"I just love October so much!!! It gets dark at like 7-9pm now, it's the perfect temperature, there is a perfect vibe in the air, everything is pretty, Halloween is just around the corner, and there is always this amazing scent in that air! I'm so happy it's finally October!!!",0
"I was at a frat party in college, and saw this super cute girl that I had seen before at a few prior parties, and decided fuck it, I went up to her, started making small talk, we then started dancing, one thing lead to another and Mr. Brightside started playing, and I decided to kiss her when the lyrics ""It started out with a kiss"" happened, I think she liked it because we then started making out. I am still so happy and cant stop thinking about it.",0
"I am terrible with my hands, i can't change a lightbulb without burning off half an eyebrow. 

the conclusion of both these things happened today but i'm presenting them separately for clarity.

my engine starter coils were giving out and i was told i'd have to replace my spark plugs soon. the mechanic would be more than willing to do it for like $75-100. i said i'd think about it but i changed them all myself. (it cost me like 60$ for the tools but still)

a couple days ago, i decided to move an outlet so i could power my tv without running an extension cord in front of my furnace's door. but after being quoted like $150-200 to move the outlet 4ft, an electrician finally told me it was a relatively simple diy - i'd mostly be paying for his time. so, i moved the outlet 4ft away. it took me the better part of 3hrs (bc the previous owners did something really weird and i didn't mark the wires like i should have) 

but i did them both. me. all by lonesome. without having to ask for help.",0
"My daughters haven't always had the easiest hand in life. It's been one thing on top of another, we even moved to a new town partly to get away from certain people. To help cope and to keep them busy, my daughters turned to writing. They started with short stories, then plays, to now entire screenplays some of which run to about 10-15 minutes long. They, and I, would greatly appreciate if you can check them out and give your opinion. They are educational yet entertaining for kids. Both girls want to be screenwriters someday and are even listed with the IMDb (Internet Movie Database). Please consider subscribing to see more.

"This sub has really gotten downhill. I'm really tired of seeing the same content reposted over and over. When it's not blatant reposts, it's usually generic selfies that end up clearly serving the purpose of getting people to visit the posters' OF/other pages.",0
"Last year, I was a HCA working ungodly shifts throughout lockdown. I was burned out and the fear of the virus (among other things) brought back the agoraphobia I'd had as a teen.

I'd joined a dating site a few months prior to lockdown, and I soon matched with a gorgeous guy, ""H"", who was interested in the same things as me, and wanted the same things in life as I did. It was difficult for me to imagine going out to meet him though, both because of the virus, and because of my agoraphobia. It got to a point where I was having panic attacks on the 10 minute bus to/from work. How the heck would I manage travelling into town, on a 40 minute commute to meet someone new, for a *first date* of all things? Talk about pressure!

So I made a post on a dating/relationship advice sub, and although I don't follow that sub anymore, a few really kind users reached out both on the post and in DMs. They validated my feelings, and made me feel so recognised. I got some great advice about ideas for places to go, including quieter places, and what to do, including buying a fidget cube which I definitely used on the journey up there! For the location, I chose a small, quiet coffee shop, to meet up with him on 6th October - two days before my birthday. 

The users there also encouraged me to be honest with him about the agoraphobia. I was worried it was going to put him off, as the agoraphobia pushed away friends and partners alike over the years, having them assume I was a flake and didn't want to see them when I really did. But I was honest anyway - to my relief, H was sympathetic, not at all judgemental. Our first date was a dream; no panic attacks at all, and he made me feel so safe and comfortable. Over time, we went on more and more dates, and my agoraphobia slowly began to shrink away.

There was one occasion when I did actually have a panic attack on one of our dates on a walk around the canal. I can normally hide it, but H picked up on it straight away, got me some water and walked me home, all the while telling me I was safe and reminding me we could stop and sit down any time. I felt so loved.

We're celebrating one year together next week, from our first date at the coffee shop, on the 6th October. And it's my 30th birthday on the 8th. So we're going sight-seeing on a four-day city break, which is something I would be so nauseous about trying last year!

I just feel so happy. And I'm so glad I managed to conquer my demon once again, which I don't think I'd be able to do without support from the Reddit users who'd been in the same boat! To anyone struggling with their own demons, remember that there are people out there who know how you feel, who won't judge you or take it personally when your demons affect your plans - and I encourage anyone to find strength and support in numbers. Your feelings are valid! I'm forever grateful for the ideas and the kindness to encourage me to meet such a wonderful man.

Hope you all have a great week! ðŸ¥°",0
"Feeling emotions I havenâ€™t in a while

Hello. I doubt this goes anywhere or to anyone, but it feels right to type it out and send it to someone else in the world. Havenâ€™t had much luck recently w anything and coming out of a long relationship didnâ€™t help. However, I met a girl on a dating app and pursued it outside of online interactions. We have continued to hang out and it genuinely just feels so good to feel appreciated again. Sure, friends and family offer love and attention that feels great and is necessary. However, attention with romantic intent is something that cannot be found as easily and deserves appreciation and acknowledgment. 

It feels good to feel like I am a young teen with butterflies in my stomach again. It feels good to learn about someone new and all they have experienced in this life so far. It feels good to be me right now and I canâ€™t say that often, so I want to when and while
I can. :) 

If you have read this far, I wish nothing but the best for you in this little journey we are all going through. I love you and I will never even know you",0
"I never though that that was possible for me, but then my boyfriend came along and changed my mind. 

I love how he notices the little things about me and his massive amount of patience with me. I love how he is healing from his past for himself, and how I am seeing him grow into a better person. I love his forehead kisses and him rubbing my back while we shower together, and I love how goofy we can be. But the way he looks at me makes me feel like we are in a romance movie.


Donâ€™t ever settle for less than that, ever.",0
"I didn't think I'd make it. It's been over 4 years and it's been so hard, confusing and depressing. It's difficult to compare life to what it was like before I started because I'm not the same person any more.
I hear PhD-induced depression is really common. Now it's over I've had so much more motivation, energy and appreciation for all my friends and family.

I'm so glad for the opportunity, but it really is about the friends we made on the way :)",0

"Pretty much the title. I have really awful self-confidence, and I've been trying to work on it for years. Last week I went to a big outdoor event with friends, where it was expected to dress up sexy and show skin. I wore one of my favorite outfits and felt cute, but I was so afraid of the photos that would come back to me afterward. I always feel like I look so much worse in the photos. 

But somehow, not this time. Not only did I feel amazing all day, but when my friends shared all of their photos that night I finally feel like I look AMAZING! Every single photo of me I was actually happy with. I look so hot and so happy in every single one. 

I finally feel like I'm making progress. But more than anything, being able to just value photos of good times in my life with the people I love without overthinking it feels incredible.",0

"My (26F) suicide attempt gladly failed 3 days ago. I feel so whole with the fact that Iâ€™m ready to change for the better Iâ€™ve always wanted and for meee. Not a relationship, it seemed so impossible. I feel like my thoughts and reactions are controllable, theyâ€™re mine! Lol That being a good person has been in me the entire time Iâ€™m not bad, just made bad decisions that I can just not repeat. I didnâ€™t believe people when they told me I was good. I def donâ€™t believe any less now. I was really struggling with a break up and lost my mind kind of lol but I found myself and Iâ€™ve been awesome. If he comes back Iâ€™ll take him but with stern standards and if we break up, Iâ€™ll have me so Iâ€™ll be fine. I found a way to quiet my negative chatter thoughts. I just literally say â€˜shut upâ€™ and switch to something realistic, positive and stick to it. I refuse to be sad and anxiety ridden anymore. I am still open to trying mood stabilizers though eh lol",0

He is aware of me organizing and doesn't mind. I've got several episodes of my favorite podcast lined up and I've all the supplies ready. I know it's weird to brag about cleaning but I can't wait!",0

"Hi everyone! I took a leap and told this guy Iâ€™ve been crushing on in school about my feelings towards him and I was surprised to find out he feels the same way. Iâ€™m so nervous! I donâ€™t know if I messed up because we hung out last night and he asked to kiss me but I wasnâ€™t ready and said something along the lines of â€œNot yet, but in the future absolutely.â€ He said heâ€™s looking forward to it.

I just had to tell someone this. Wish me luck guys. I hope I donâ€™t get my heart broken again. I just canâ€™t believe I had the courage to actually tell him. Do guys find that attractive?",0
"I just feel very happy today. Things are starting to look up for me!! I am enjoying my new job and I was able to pay off some debts and buy groceries for the family. I hope you guyd are having a great day, too!",0
"I ordered Uber eats for the first time since I had a $30 coupon. I heard about how bad they rape you for money especially when you use them often. Anyway I still had to come out of pocket almost 15 bucks with charges &amp; taxes so when the tip screen comes up I put a big fat donut for tipâ€¦ I chose the hand off option so I could tip her cash (since I donâ€™t know if their tips are taxed). I get the alert sheâ€™s pulling up so when I walk up to her car she hands all the food to me in one hand, &amp; before I take the drinks with the other I reach in my pocket to give her the 10 bucks I grabbed before walking outside. She sees it first &amp; lets off a big gasp like in the movies then I look down and see a Benjamin stuck on top of the 10. I peel them apart to hand her the $10 and immediately felt like shit after grabbing my drinks from her. Thru her mask I could see her disappointment so I gave her the 100 bucks anyway. Funny story thought I would tell somebody",0
"I woke up to texts in our groupchat talking about planning a trip to an AirBnB in the city. They both live in 2 different cities hours away from me so we donâ€™t get to see each other that often. We havenâ€™t seen each other since last year I think. 

I looked at the AirBnB one of them sent and I was startled because of the price. Also because of the fact that she said weâ€™d be splitting the cost between usâ€¦ or at least thatâ€™s the impression I was under. 

I had to let them down gently and tell them I wouldnâ€™t be able to go because I need all the money I can get my hands on right now to pay for some therapy sessions since I faced some serious trauma 5 years ago that needs resolving. My friend just sent back â€œwho said youâ€™re paying?â€ And I was just soâ€¦ at a loss for words. Because I havenâ€™t been able to get a stable job due to my mental health issues, theyâ€™ve covered for me multiple times in the past, so I thought theyâ€™d appreciate me taking the initiative and not assume anyoneâ€™s gonna pay for me.

I insisted because I didnâ€™t want to keep mooching off of them. And she basically just said that it wouldnâ€™t be the same without me there.. and I couldâ€™ve cried when I read that statement. 

Itâ€™s just nice to know you have friends that want you around no matter what. Weâ€™ve been friends for 6 years and I love them to death. I consider them family. And I just couldnâ€™t be happier right now",0
"So, I've always wanted to get one of my ears pierced . I first put forward this idea when I was about 16 to my parents and cause I was in school they didn't really accept it . Today when I put forward the idea again , THEY ACCEPTED (I'm 19). So finally, I'll be getting my ear pierced ! Thank you for reading .",0
"So long story short, and I know itâ€™s not allowed in this sub but itâ€™s a footnote in this story, I (f, 30) very recently split from my husband, I have wanted to leave for so long but had no fight left until this wonderful person (m, 30) from my past contacted me out of the blue.

He showed me how love should feel, and tbh he still is. We talk daily and heâ€™s just the most positive, worldly person I have ever known. He makes me feel sexy and he makes me feel loved. He told me he was proud of me for telling my husband I wanted to leave, he told me Iâ€™m not a burden.

He gives me butterflies and makes me smile more than I have in a long time. 

While weâ€™re not IN love with each other (he has some past trauma of his own) I love him so dearly and have found myself wanting to keep his beautiful smile on his equally gorgeous face. 

I love you N, and I hope you will always be in my life.",0
"So I was at school today and a girl from my class, was really nice to me. We talked after a lesson, while we moved out. She said that the teacher (which is fairly new to us) is really nice and she like her. I answered that i actually also like her, because she started being nice to me (she was kinda cold to me before). So the girl I was talking to said: ""Everybody has to like you and your humor, after they start to know you a bit."" I know this isnÂ´t much, but it made me so fucking happy. Because it was an completely honest compliment and iam not used to such things. And it felt extra good because my last days were not really nice. Maybe we should all try to compliment more.

Sorry if you cant understand something, my english isnÂ´t really good.",0
"So I work in a pub and recently, my management team has started taking notice of the quality standards of my work. I've been receiving recognition and praise for the high standards I've been setting. 

Now, I've been Asthmatic all my life, and all my doctor would ever tell me was to use a blue inhaler. Worst advice ever. 

I've finally started to see an Asthma specialist and to say it's taken too long is a huge understatement, but my Asthma is finally being controlled properly.

I can breathe!

And in a two-for, or a three-for? I've been losing weight. My Weight loss is coming on very nicely. I Was told this morning it's noticeable that I've lost weight. 

Recognition, feeling better and losing weight! Actually starting to feel good about things.

This is that positivity I keep hearing about. Feels good man",0
"Like many others, my mental health took a huge hit over the last year and a half. In 2019 I was cruising through writing book 5 in my series and then all hell broke loose. 

Personal life, professional life, it all took a hit. I went on the meds, found a counselor, and got myself put back together. We relocated across state and that seems to have helped get my SO and me back on track. 

I was afraid Iâ€™d lost the story telling bug. Iâ€™m thrilled itâ€™s still here, and Iâ€™m looking forward to beginning the next one. Iâ€™ll be flexing my creative wings and trying a new genre. I am very excited!",0
"I'm an older autistic person. For a long time, I didn't have any friends. When I was a teenager I had some friends, but my life got really bad for a long time so I didn't even try to make friends. Recently I made some very great friends because of a video game we all like. We are all on the spectrum, try to defy autism stereotypes, and are planning to all meet up one day when it's safer to travel. :)",0

I finally got my degree after having to leave college because of money problems, Iâ€™m starting to get prepared to apply for an MBA, Iâ€™m getting amazing job offers, I feel less angry and stressed. I am reconnecting with old friends and overall I just feel the future looks so much brighter. 

Donâ€™t give up :) It gets better!",0
"After smoking cigarettes for almost 40 years I have finally quit for good. I struggled for so long to find the will power to make it happen, I had almost given up hope that I would ever be able to stop. I know we all have to do it for our reasons but I hope that anyone who see this and has struggled as long as I did might find a little inspiration to keep trying. Good luck!",0

"All of the sacrifices I did for a year and a half was worth it. I'm not good at anything except being an aviation enthusiast. I was confused and hopeless a year ago in the midst of pandemic when the industry got hit so bad, yet I still pursued my passion in aviation and now more opportunities are coming for me.. ðŸ¥º I even got to ride a helicopter for free lmao so fun!!!! I'm really not an openly emotional kind of person so I'm just gonna say it here: I'm very grateful to everyone who became a part of my life.",0
"FINALLY today we got to go on the whale watching trip that I booked for our anniversary in July. He loves being on the water and he was so excited to go so Iâ€™m so happy we got to do this. It was beautiful we saw multiple humpback whales and many gorgeous bottlenose dolphins!! It was such a lovely experience together! Afterwards, we got really yummy ice cream and had a great lunch by the water where I surprised him with his Christmas present and I really think he is happy about it. I got him tickets to an event in November so I had to give it to him early. We were also going to go ring shopping today which is exciting but the cruise ran a little late so we didnâ€™t make it to the store before they closed so weâ€™re going another day.",0

"I was so used to be by myself as I live alone and my typical routine wouls be go to work come home go to sleep and do it all again. My family is prettt much out the picture. And other peope in my life have just fallen off the grid.
I told a new friend that I met a few months ago that I was thinking of moving out and she responded, ""well if you need help painting the place let Tom and I know. You got friends.""
I feel like crying. It feels surreal knowing that there's someone out there that would do that for me. I hope I have more moments like this.",0
"Ok, I just wanted to tell someone this, but I really donâ€™t talk with any of my friends about all of thisâ€¦. Almost exactly 3 years ago I asked a girl outâ€¦.I donâ€™t know why she said yes, but she didâ€¦.she is the most beautiful person Iâ€™ve met, everything she does puts a smile on my faceâ€¦ I am really not very emotionalâ€¦but she makes me feel happiness and some times I wouldnâ€™t say she makes me feel sad but rather an effect of something she does makes me feel sadâ€¦But the truth is, I just want to hold her in my arms and slowly watch the sunsetâ€¦ I want to wake up in the morning and see her, when Iâ€™m stressed out I just want to talk with her because her voice makes me smile. I never actually knew I was the long term relationship guy, but I want to spend my life with her and I honestly canâ€™t wait for our 3 year anniversaryâ€¦. I donâ€™t know if this is the right subreddit but yeah Iâ€™m more than happyâ€¦ Iâ€™m in love :) 

I love you my sweet potato:)",0
"When Covid started we canceled vacations and weekends and decided to make larger payments to the loan. Then stimulus money started coming and since we were both working we dumped all that into the payments too. So now after a year and a half of having no spare money we did it. And it's all done forever!

Tonight we are having champagne and cake and you're all invited!!",0
"high, i am trying to figure out what makes me happy. i used to get that really happy feeling that made me feel like i could do anything, maybe when i was 7 or 8 but now I'm 15 and I 've been thinking, I haven't felt that feeling in ages. i tried doing all the stuff that gave me that feeling a while ago, and I can't seem to get it back. how did you figure out what made you happy? maybe you can help me figure that out.",0
"Iâ€™ve been practicing yoga for almost 8 years now and it has become my lifeâ€™s passion. 

I started practicing to straighten my posture (which had become crooked after an operation on both feet (age 14) and a lack of physiotherapy that left my in the obligation to learn how to walk again, on my own.) This has been a great challenge both mentally and physically.

Once I became an adult and completed my yoga teacher training, I worked relentlessly for about 3 years to start a business. All I wanted to do was help people and the planet and was so eager to contribute. 
(I had problems with self confidence and public speaking my whole life. It was a huge challenge for me to talk in front of people.)

Last summer, I got a contract with the city I currently live in, to teach 12 yoga classes for the upcoming autumn session. I was so happy and excited but also stressed out! 
At some points I thought my head would explode because of the stress but I remembered everything that yoga is and managed to get through it. 

Last Tuesday, I taught a group class (14 students) and it went amazingly well! The students gave good reviews and seemed to have really enjoyed it! 
The person that hired me said that she had to stop the registrations because there was too many people that wanted to take the classes! She told me my contract would be renewed for the winter session and that there would be two classes a week instead of one! 

Iâ€™m on a cloud right now to think that my career is really taking off and that Iâ€™ll be able to share yoga with the world! 

Thank you for reading! 

TL;DR : Spent years working on myself and my yoga business. Got a contract with my city to teach 12 classes (once a week) in autumn and just learned the contract will be renewed and upgraded (two classes a week for winter session)! Yay!",0

"That just about sums up everything. The day I got the offer letter was one of the happiest of my entire life. I became the most successful person in my entire family overnight. I had a single mother who treated me like shit. I was depressed. My life got better after I got clean, and it was far more challenging and rewarding than I could've ever imagined. A week after I got the job, I met a beautiful sweet girl and I felt like I won the jackpot twice in one month.

Work was insane for the first 2 months. It ground me down to a shell of who I was just a few weeks before. This week I finished a massive project I've been working on since I started. So excited about it.

No one and nothing can ever stop me from achieving my dreams. Every single thing I've ever done professionally has been a success.

My greatest wish is to be able to pass these skills and opportunities down to someone else in need. Someone at the very bottom of our world like I was with the potential to do better. And when their time comes, I wish for them to pass it on too.",0
So for years Iâ€™ve had depression and basically never felt okay especially recently with going through a break up. But today I went to the gym and made my first ever full meal. Beef stroganoff. and it tastes amazing and my dad agrees. And for the first time since I donâ€™t even know that dark pit in my chest is filled with happiness and I am actually genuinely smiling. I am so happy right now and this is the best day ever!!!,0
"I have come such a long way with my therapy, I have realised so many things about me and how much work ive put in them to change, and I can finally say that I have stopped blaming myself for everything, I have finally realised how much I deserve, my self worth and i gained back my self respect that was lost over the years of toxic relationships. My mind isnt fully healed for sure, i still have a long way to become what I truly want to become. I started doing everything I had set back because I was waiting for something, I am doing my drivers, im doing my computer course, im traveling next month, and im already applying for jobs, I am focusing on myself and I am so proud of me. To some this may sound these are normal for someone to do or to have but they arent for me. For so long i was avoiding my mental issues and I havent been happier for going to therapy, I was so scared at first, but my therapist opened my eyes to so many things. I am truly grateful. We are the boss of our mind and when we learn to control it, we are unstoppable. Living hasnt felt this good for a long time!",0
"It's almost the end of my second week as an oncology nurse (graduated school over the summer) and for once in my life, I feel like I'm doing something worth while. I LOVE my new job. The people are so friendly, the patients are incredibly strong and wonderful people, the schedule is perfect (M-F 7-4 closed every holiday and weekend), the pay is twice what I used to make, and I'm doing what I'd only dreamed of doing. I suffered through years of toxic relationships, soul-draining drug addictions, and major depression on the journey to where I'm at right now and it actually paid off. I really can't overstate how happy I am. Cheers everyone &lt;3",0
"I've already experience with therapy but during rona, with no job, university at home, fearing my partner might get ill, no seeing friends anymore, no going out and so on, depression and eating disorder came back. I decided to get help in summer last year and first it got worse. I really feard I might never get better. And now here I am. A few month ago we changed to a two week schedule, had a three week schedule a few times and it was completely fine. I had a lot to talk about but rather about new exciting good stuff, than therapy themes. We even finished the last three appointments after only 20 minutes because there was just nothing to therapy anymore. And it felt better and better. I had to use recovery records (app for eating disorders where you log in every meal, feeling and thoughts and your therapist can read it) and since quite a while I felt rather annoyed about it and forgot a few times because it just didn't take up my mind anymore. For the last month we went without it and I felt so free and happy and good again.
She asked me if there were some things that got to less time or if I am afraid about certain things in the future and when I said I would liked to dig into my childhood a bit deeper she said ""But this is something you could do on your own, too. You're so strong and smart you've learnt so much, you're completely capable of dealing with this"" and this made me to proud and a bit teary-eyed.
I am truly happy and so thankful. She is an awesome therapist and the first who really fully helped me. I feel confident and strong and I am excited for the future.
TL;DR : today was my last therapy appointment and I am so happy, I feel thankful and strong and ready for the future.",0
"I have a wonderful doctor whoâ€™s been helping me monitor my meds and I feel like the current concoction of abilify, adderall and venlafaxine is actually working. Iâ€™m in a much better mood today than I have been in months.",0
"I lived most of my life believing and feeling bad for being very different from the rest. Growing up, and even up until now, I was labeled and treated as a monster for acting the way I do by my blood relatives. Before I learned of my values, I was very toxic, but they are not without fault. They were the reason why I developed mental illnesses in the first place. 

I spent some years wallowing in my misery that I can never *belong*, and being a social butterfly didn't help me because that meant I didn't belong to any group, though I was made to feel and *was* welcomed. My 2020 was a horrible year - not just because COVID broke out. But this year, I've been actively looking for communities I can relate to and one community I finally feel belonged is the mental health community.

It also helps that the Chinese MMORPG I'm playing has many wonderful people I can call friends. We're all part of one Discord server. I've also made friends with quite a lot of them and I talk to these people on a regular basis - both in game and off game. I've also been able to have a few phone calls and group calls here and there. Despite hard and trying times in my life right now, not just because it's still COVID, I'm really enjoying this season. *I finally belong!*",0

"Hello everyone! Happy World Gratitude Day!

Iâ€™ve spent the last few months thinking over the last few years of my life trying to figure out what couldâ€™ve helped me deal with my problems and saved me from those tough times of having a body disorder, bouts with mild depression, and just severe self-critique. And, could it be something that would be helpful universally?

I figured out one thing that was common between everyone who Iâ€™d seen struggle a lot, and it was the poor health of the relationship that they had with themselves. I heard my friends talk about themselves so cruelly and it broke my heart because what I would say to them would be the stark opposite of it. But, then I realized that was how I would talk to myself too. We were all hateful to ourselves. But, why? It definitely wasnâ€™t helping.

Disclaimer: Shameless plug ahead :P

So, I decided to create a 21-day self-love course that would help people like you and me form a better relationship with ourselves. To help us become our own friends. Even if we canâ€™t control everything that happens to us, we can control how we behave with ourselves through those things. Itâ€™s free to take and I just want to share it hoping it can help someone out there because we really do deserve to feel loved, especially by ourselves. I wish you well :)

"It might not seem like much - everyone finds a new job one day, that's normal. I've been at my workplace for 4 years, helped build the place from the ground up only to be pushed aside when the new manager came in, a xenophobic asslamp who never had anything good to say to me.
Today, I handed in my resignation letter. I never truly understood how bad I was feeling working there, not until I started crying like a child and I never felt this kind of relief.
At the end of the day, if you're not happy, then it's not worth it. Take care of yourselves.",0
"So my friend just got me a fluffy ball that I can clip to my back back (and to my overalls when I'm wearing them) AND I LOVE IT SO MUCH!! ITS SO FLUFFFFYY! We have been friends for around 2 months now and I've found a new reason to go to school and be happy, their also friends with my crush so now I'm friends with him :D",0
"I've had a fragile ego for a long time, and I've been very insecure about myself. This came with its challenges as I'd never want to be seen as weak. I want to show that I am good at things which made me extremely competitive.
However, through differences in my outlook on life and my own growth as a person, I am fixing this. I'm so happy that I am seeking help and tutoring for school subjects that I struggle with, and I don't mind how others view me too much. A toxic personality trait that I had in the past was that I hated to lose to a girl in physical sports or activities: armwrestling or soccer or badminton etc. It's not a trait that I liked to have, but it was ingrained in who I was. I felt so bad and angry in highschool when I lost my position as a golf captain to a girl who just started playing her senior year because she was naturally gifted, and picked up the sport easily, so much so that even after just one season, she was picked for D2 golf in college.
However, today, in a small badminton tournament at school, I was obliterated by this one girl in fast badminton and lost 11-1, and I wasn't pissed off or salty. I had a lot of fun, and vsing her just motivated me to work harder and try to beat her next time. I'm not happy that I lost, but I'm happy that I had the opportunity to vs someone so talented. I'm motivated to work harder and get better. I don't mind being seen as weak anymore. I'm happy being who I am.
No one's good at the start, and sometimes people hit their limits and can't get better, but that's ok. I want to grow to be the best version of myself that I can be. I don't have to be the best person at anything. I just want to be the best me!",0
"22F with depression/pessimism and trust issues here, got tired of wallowing in self pity and decided to make a change. Hereâ€™s to the future, hopefully filled with happiness.",0
"I(M21) asked a girl in my class if sheâ€™d like to grab lunch together and she said yes. She also said she has a boyfriend which made me sad :(. She said we could be friends though, so I said bet.

We got along really well and even though I was extremely nervous, and anxious, I got through it.

She even told me that she actually thought I was cool and has been wanting to get to know me better for a while, so this is a win in my opinion",0
"So, if you look through my post history, I mention that my aunt and uncle separated when I was little after my aunt had a miscarriage. They stayed together for a little while but ended up separating when I was 4 I think. Growing up, they tended to avoid each other whenever possible. But they were never bad to me or anything like that. For example, if the family was together at someone's house for Christmas or whatever, either my aunt or uncle would be there, never the two of them at the same time. Or, if they were both there, they didn't talk to each other and just avoided crossing their paths. Never shouting or yelling or anything like that, just trying to pretend they weren't there.

Fast forward to now. I've said many times in other posts how my uncle has basically become like my dad these past few years, changing drastically for the better from the version of him I grew up knowing. He even has a spot on his dresser in his room that are just photos of him and me from when I was little to now. That's how much he cares about me. And I spent the past weekend with him like I usually do. I woke up Sunday and expected it to just be us for breakfast. But instead, I come down and my aunt is there.

They're just casually chatting about whatever. I almost couldn't believe what I was seeing. I legit could not remember the last time they spoke to each other. And here they are making each other laugh. So the three of us had breakfast together and it was nice. It really was. They even said they were planning on spending the day together!

Now, again, I don't mean to make assumptions. But the fact that they're in each other's presence like this makes me giddy. I especially am happy for my uncle since, even though he has me in his life, he lives all by himself (so does my aunt of course but still). And it kills me a little every time I reject his offer to do something together when I have plans with my friends or boyfriend. I genuinely hope something good happens between them",0
"While I was at work today, I learned that I'm actually eligible for health insurance and the largest bill is the first one but after that it's only a few dollars to call them and have a conversation. I can get a diagnosis and some medications if needed which is honestly really almost ground breaking for me. I've been going through a lot and my parents refused to actually put me in therapy and what not awhile ago so it's just a great feeling that I can finally do that.

Another great thing is the fact that my manager came up to me and let me know that she's going to move some people around and possibly give me a higher paying position than she originally planned. That honestly was just great to find out especially given the fact that it's a $7.50 raise. I was struggling for money at the beginning of the year and the fact that I won't have to worry about that as much once I get this position is just amazing. I'm just super excited and I should be starting around Saturday if everything works out :)",0
"I never thought Iâ€™d get to this day and need to get this out or Iâ€™ll burst.
Some background, all of my closest family are naturalized US citizens, but Iâ€™m not. I had lived on the East Coast for almost a decade as a student. I spent my 20s with the fear of giving up my life once the visas run out loomed over every decisions I made, while my best friends plan their lives with weddings and job promotions and babies and buying houses. The company where I interned offered to sponsor me, but itâ€™s always a lengthy process with unclear real chances.
Then it happened. I did have to leave the country. Everything and everyone I know is here and Iâ€™d do anything to stay, except being an illegal immigrant. My boyfriend of the same predicament left with me. We found jobs in Singapore and stayed there while my company files for my immigration. Iâ€™ll never forget how it felt taking picnic baskets with my friends, scouting venues for a fall New England wedding that eventually never came to be. We got married at the embassy in Singapore, not knowing a single soul. We stayed for 3 years at god awful jobs, met interesting people but our life has no sense of home or future. But this year, a month after I turned 30, my green card came through. Iâ€™m going back to a great company, and my now-husband immediately got an offer for 230k/year because he piggybacked through me and does not need a sponsorship. I never allowed myself to believe so many good things could happen all at once. I was cautiously optimistic about my green card, but thought Iâ€™ll be a sole earner for a while as weâ€™ll be recent immigrants. Now weâ€™re going back to our dream city, working at our dream jobs, planning for our dream home.
Weâ€™ve just landed in the US today and I couldnâ€™t sleep because I couldnâ€™t stop crying. Iâ€™ve never cried happy before. Iâ€™m sure weâ€™ll run into issues and have stress at work and bad things will happen because itâ€™s life, but just for now, everything is just absolutely perfect. I donâ€™t know if I deserve all this and if someone was watching over me made this happened, idk God? Buddha? Allah? My brother? Thank you. Also Iâ€™ll probably get comments about stealing American jobs or soiling your culture and whatnot. If thatâ€™s how you feel idk what to tell you. Iâ€™ll be paying more taxes here than the whole of my income in Singapore. I hope some of it goes to helping you personally.",0
"I had no job. No money. No car. I was newly divorced. Fast forward to today.... I graduated school, top of my class, I start my new career in healthcare next week, I bought and paid off my car, and I have the most loyal, supportive and loving boyfriend I have ever had. I made it you guys!",0
iâ€™ve always struggled thinking about the future because to be honest i didnâ€™t see myself making it long enough to see the point in it. recently though iâ€™ve been thinking about what i want in my life. they are very broad goals but itâ€™s something! it feels good to work towards something again :) hope you all are well &lt;3,0
"It was off the cuff and impromptu, but it was to say he was proud of me and what I am doing. All my life he has given me the latitude to chart my own course in life and when I decided what I was going to do, I promised I was going to make him proud. Recently Iâ€™ve worked hard to put together the perfect little life by the sea Iâ€™ve envisioned for myself and so much of it is clicking. My businesses are going strong, Iâ€™ve made a good number of friends already, found a mentor, and have been given some truly amazing opportunities.

I guess I had finally done enough that he get I deserved to do hear what I had promised him. There was a reason I chose to go to the same college he did and my grandma did, the legacy I know I follow in. It means the world to me to know Iâ€™ve managed to bring him the honor he deserves. I wouldnâ€™t be the man I am without him.",0
"a few of my close friends and i have a group chat. we discuss weekend plans, talk about internal issues, share posts, etc.

it makes me happy when my friends share something theyre excited about or recently discovered. for example, today one of us talked about a book by an author they like, and how the book had introduced characters from the authors separate series. the messages were filled with plenty of capitalisation and exclamation marks, and it was just a nice thing to be witness to.

it makes me feel better about sharing things i like, to the group chat. it's also nice that they feel comfortable sharing what they love with us.

hope you all have a great day and hear from friends and family about something good in their lives, or yours.",0
"I donâ€™t really know where else to talk about this, so I figured Iâ€™d try here. Ever since I got assaulted, Iâ€™ve had a huge disconnect with anything sexual. It has been impossible for me to have an orgasm and itâ€™s been so incredibly frustrating. I donâ€™t know why, but for some reason, I was working out really hard, and BAM! I had an orgasm. It was the first one in seven years. I completely forgot what it felt like. Now, I did not ejaculate, so there was no mess, but the release was there. Seven years of pent up sexual frustration was released in an instant and I felt like a new person.",0
"AND I AM SO SO EXCITED!! 

super nervous, but so excited. I have toyed with the idea for the last couple of years but I felt like I had nothing holding me back so I got a job that I honestly can't wait wait to start and a place to stay. 

I need to express my happiness to more people because I think my family and friends have heard it enough, hehe. 

Here's to a new chapter :D",0
"So, I told my parents the truth about something, (I ain't gonna tell) and they weren't even mad! It feels so good to get that out of my system!",0
"My boyfriend and I are both in our mid twenties and just had our four years anniversary.

He is a gamer and I saw a plushie of one of his favorite games and wanted to buy it for a while now but there was no reason for it and my boyfriend doesn't like getting presents just randomly and even for his birthday or holidays he doesn't want much. I am basically the same, I don't like that it's all about spending and huge gifts. I didn't got presents at all as a child or to make up for mistakes and ""prove"" I was ""loved"" so I am kinda allergic to huge expensive presents myself lol.

However the plushie wasn't expensive, it was just too much to buy it without a reason. He was soooo happy and like a little child and oh my gosh his eyes sparkled and I fell in love with him even more.

He got quite afterwards and a bit sad and said he wanted to remember our anniversary but forgot and didn't had a present because he didn't knew what to get me.

But.. He randomly brought me my favorite ice tea on this day which is only available close to his office.
And that's just the best present I could ask for. He thought of me. I was in his mind. He thought ""Oh let's get girlfriend her favorite ice tea just to make her happy"" and that means so much to me. Also because I don't even know what he could got me myself. When we make each other presents we always say only small things, not more than 50$ and I just have everything I need and want right now. I wouldn't even be comfortable getting an expensive present. 

So long story short: I am just so happy and thankful for my boyfriend and relationship. Sounds cheesy but he's the best that ever happened to me and he's one of the very few people who were there for me when things were really difficult. He was always supportive, listened, cuddled me when I needed it and motivated me to get help and get better. He himself is already the best present.

TL;DR : title sums it up basically",0
"Trigger warning: Small talk of Suicide and self harm

Oh where to begin. My life has been living hell since Boxing Day 2019. I cried myself to sleep for 3 months straight after that day then couldnâ€™t anymore because my tear ducts were doing a big â€œF Uâ€. 

I struggled a lot with self esteem mainly with how I look and act. Literally 3 minutes ago I looked in the mirror and said â€œyou look hotâ€ and I finally feel good inside! I donâ€™t think it will last but for once in almost 2 years I donâ€™t want to off myself and as off right now I donâ€™t want to do what I normally do when i feel down which is harming my body.

"This is where Iâ€™m at right now and I feel so lucky and happy to be in this quiet house in this cozy moment - I just had to share it with someone! Iâ€™m curled up in bed, just finished a good book. My cat is purring at my feet, itâ€™s that perfect temperature where itâ€™s chilly but not enough to shut the windows. Thereâ€™s just a soft breeze so Iâ€™m fine by the window wrapped in a duvet. It was sunny all day and the bed is made up of fresh sheets that dried on the line, they smell like sunbeams and the forest. It just started raining and Iâ€™m in the room with the awning over the window that has that lovely pitter patter sound, the window cracked enough to let in that amazing rain smell, you know the one. I took a shower before bed, after deep cleaning the house yesterday and burning scented candles all night tonight which somehow adds to that extra clean feeling. I made dinner earlier, Italian with local produce, the herbs and tomatoes were from my own garden. My guy baked us an apple rhubarb crumble after while I did the washing up, with apples from our tree outside and rhubarb from the neighbour. I added some vanilla ice cream, we didnâ€™t have enough of our own strawberries to bake with them too so they were a tasty fresh topping instead, divinity. We rolled a joint from the plant we just harvested from our garden and shared it afterwards. The cat got fresh catnip from the garden and tuckered himself out bouncing around chasing moths. I have the day off tomorrow so no alarms are set tonight. The coffee maker is set to go with coffee for the morning, every once in a while the breeze brings that fresh ground coffee smell by. We are deep enough in the woods now that I canâ€™t see our neighbours, but I can smell that they have their wood stove going through the damp chilly night air as well. We donâ€™t have to share our house with any roommates anymore, so weâ€™ve left the music going in the far room for extra white noise. Radiohead in the rain is extra soothing you guys. Thereâ€™s an owl softly hooting outside and a couple of tree frogs singing in the distance. We live close enough to the ocean now that every now and then I can also hear a foghorn going softly way in the distance by the lighthouse, weâ€™ve been suffering a drought so itâ€™s been a while since Iâ€™ve heard it. My guy is snoring peacefully and the cats purring has turned into soft snores as well, his little feet are twitching while he dreams.

Iâ€™ve dealt with a lot of negative crap this past while, moved 13 times in the last 4 years, cross country in there too, and havenâ€™t really had â€˜homeâ€™ for a while. Living out of vehicles was part of the tougher times.. but soaking in the little things like this lovely night in keep me so very happy with my forested escape in my little comfy house and all the hard work done in getting here, and ready for the hard work yet to come. I hope you get a chance to stop and appreciate the little things youâ€™ve worked hard to have today too!",0
"John Lenin once said, ""Life is what happens when you are making other plans."" And he was right. Today, I received the offer to become the director of a gallery owned by a world class photographer who has been an idol of mine for years. I've talked to him extensively at this point and he is wise beyond his years as well someone I connect with on a very deep level. This studio is just one of several he owns, but its location is in my favorite part of San Diego and he's even going to give me the autonomy to do things like make my own hours. The position will also fit nicely with my photography and there is room for a lot of growth in the future.

I know this sounds stupid, but I have tears in my eyes thinking about it, what I have been entrusted with and where it can lead. I've been wanting a simple life with an apartment, a transition of sorts to change up my career and work, and a great gym to workout and shoot hoops. I now have 2/3 of these things and I am just so grateful. Today by far has been one of the best days of my life.",0

My happy mail usually includes an encouraging letter, stickers, mental health worksheets &amp; positive quotes. Itâ€™s completely free and writing back/responding is optional.

"So I posted a few days ago about how my uncle, who's been like a dad to me these past few years, dropped his plans with his friends and watched a football game with me just so he could spend time with me. Well, during halftime, I went upstairs and used the bathroom. I came out and for some reason just had the inclination to walk around the house a bit ever since my grandparents passed away and my uncle got the house, just to see how much it's changed. 

I went into his bedroom and saw on his dresser in front of the window the thing that nearly made me cry. There were about five photos all of me from when I was little up to now. They were also all photos he took, and the last one was of one I posted a few days ago. He also had his watch that I got him for his birthday and a few other small mementos on his dresser. Essentially, he made a space just for me. And I just sat on his bed staring at them for a good five minutes. 

I didn't have the heart to tell him I saw it though lol.",0

BUT-

Little kids shows in languages I can't speak are getting me through. Idk what it is about them, but I'm in love. I've watched so many episodes of these Dutch shows called Kaatje / Kaatjes Kameraadjes that I can kinda understand my sister's wife when she speaks Dutch now, and could even speak some sentences back to her (her look of shock was so funny when I did hehe). I seriously don't know why, but these prissy pink foreign dress-up shows where 40-year-olds act like they're 4, it just... makes me happy, idk.

Ok yeah sorry that was my little speech about Kaatje. Sorry if this wasn't allowed here, just thought I'd share my strange strategy for happy-ifying myself. You can find clips of it on YouTube if you want to check it out.",0

"Since i started my puberty i realized that i dont have the best body what would i like to have at that moment. At school nobody didnt talk about it but everyone knew that i didnt have ""big tits"" even me made jokes about it when the topic comes out to hide how insecure i rlly felt about it, part of my personality adapted to that. I was terrified of wearing tight dresses, tops, being in a swimsuit, necklines, even when i wore bra i put another shirt so it wouldnt look so flat (im 34a), i wore loose shirts as much as i could, jackets that covered me and so on. Since the pandemic started i just talked to my only 2 best friends but i dont talk to them about it, i create my reddit account, read post in communities like r/smallbooblove i noticed that there are many people who really like them, i talk to people on websites like omegle (ofc chat) and several the people said alot of positive comments about small bobs and that rlly made me so happy tbh (ik, live no matter what people think but that also that made me realize that many people do not care so), although i always knew the pros of having them small, i didnt appreciate them 100%. One day i concluded that they are cute, sexy and cool at the same time, i can now use whatever i want (without my parents' judges) and rn i feel so grateful for these babes and im so ready to start being able to be myself with the confidence that i need a big part of my life.
Hopefully one day someone can share this happiness with me.

And I ended up making a post later that night on I believe r/friends and I met 3 people in particular.

On top of that, she made my favorite Kanye cover art for an album, not a huge fan of him, but regardless it was amazing. And another one, all we did was talk about music, it was amazing. It just really helped me, I met someone who worked with a celebrity and I didn't feel alone.

"We might not be in a romantic relationship together, but we have known each other since fall 2019 (our freshman year of college). We have this tradition of having long hugs everytime we run into each other. And she's managed to make my heart melt and feel like I'm in heaven on multiple occasions. She's like the perfect hug buddy to me. We're both in our early 20s, but she has that youthful expression on her face and in her attitude. And there's just the right height difference to where I can just melt into her and she can feel protected in my arms. Prior to the hug, I can hear so much happiness in her voice and uses the right words to express it. Last time, she told me ""I miss you!"" When we literally last saw each other three days ago. All this was accompanied by very slight swaying. I love seeing her so happy. Like her life feels so perfect and all of her problems disappear when she's in my arms. Call it a special friendship, so close to each other, whatever. Even though a bf/gf relationship seems highly unlikely, she still has a special place in my heart.",0

So I adapted to keeping low, and not talking or asking for things I liked so I wouldnâ€™t get into an argument.

"So, this past year or so, I've taken more of an interest in the world of professional sports. From soccer to baseball to football, all that. I've been watching as many games and highlights as I can just because I find it so interesting. Me and my uncle, who's been like a dad to me these past two years since my actual dad left, have also gone to a few baseball games together over the summer and it's been a blast. And with the start of the NFL season, we watched some preseason games together as well.

Well yesterday was our team's first game of the season. I texted him (my uncle) asking if he was going to be watching it, he said he was and then I asked if he wanted to watch it together. He of course said yes and I went over to his place. I find out not 10 minutes after I get there that he was actually planning to go be with his friends from work and watch the game with them. He even packed a cooler of beer already lol. But he decided not to go as soon as I asked and instead wanted to be with me.

I can't describe how special I felt lol. I mean I of course want him to have friends and all that. But the fact that he put them aside just to spend time with me is something. It also made the pain of our team losing pretty much negligible so there's that.",0
i wonâ€™t go into much detail but iâ€™ve been wanting a handwriting engraved necklace for a while but i sort of gave up on asking (influencer that saved my life). i guess a few friends of mine knew i wanted it so badly so they also had asked for me. woke up few days ago and had a dm from the person. they sent me the pic and i ordered it. itâ€™s the little things that have the biggest impact on us sometimes! the universe made it happen when i least expected it and needed it badly which taught me to value the small things in life.,0

"Iâ€™ll call him R. We were in the same French 2 class and sat at the same table in 9th grade(2 years ago) for a short period of time before he moved up to the French 4-honors class (because heâ€™s from Montreal and is already fluent in French). However we did get along really well in 9th grade and I thought he was a great friend. After he moved up to the honors class I never got to see him until this year, when we landed two classes together, Literature and Art. Somehow we started a conversations 3-5 weeks ago and caught up a bit, and he said he remembered me! He speaks to me so kindly even now and he even restarted the conversation multiple times when it became silent while talking, and it honestly just makes my day being able to talk to someone so nice even if itâ€™s just for a few minutes. It really does keep me happy for the rest of the day and for days afterwards. Iâ€™m so happy that I can finally be able to get along well with someone so warm-hearted I really am so thankful 

Having at least one person whom I can look forward to seeing/talking to honestly makes me want to continue living and Iâ€™m so happy I got to reconnect with him!!!",0
"At the beginning of the year I met a girl and starting on that first night that we met I could feel a connection. Two weeks after we met though, I had to move back home while she stayed at school. We talked every day that I was away until I got the chance to visit her for a weekend. That weekend I found myself realizing how much I liked her and proved to be one of the most memorable weekends of my life and I wished I could relive it over and over. At the end of the weekend, we had no idea when we would see each other again but we continued to talk with hopes that it would be soon. A few weeks later I was offered a summer position at a company located in her home state. I ended up living in a place 10 minutes from her house. This led to the perfect summer, one that you only see in movies. I fell in love, and I fell in love hard. Iâ€™ve had past relationships where I believed that I loved them but I now realize that I truly was not because what I feel now is much different than anything Iâ€™ve ever felt. After spending the entire summer together, seeing each other every single day except for a 6 day stretch where I went away, I find myself writing this. Now that my work is over and school starts tomorrow, she helped me move into my new apartment and spent the weekend here at school before having to head back home where she works. A few hours ago we said goodbye and she hit the road, heading home for the next few weeks. Sheâ€™ll be back next month but for some reason this was still the hardest goodbye ever and the only reason I can come up with is that I truly do love this girl with everything that I am",0

3. One of my best friends in college asked me to be her bridesmaid. I knew it was coming, but when it came, it was great. Sheâ€™s someone whoâ€™s fun to be around, just a total vibe and one of the few people I actually trust. Iâ€™m genuinely happy and excited for her. (August 2021)",0

I worked on myself throughout the pandemic and ended up reconnecting with a friend that I knew since we were four.

So I told him I had been single since July and asked if heâ€™d like to go out to dinner sometime. We made plans to meet up this Saturday for dinner and drinks. Iâ€™m just really excited to see where this leads. I havenâ€™t been on a real date in so long.

"TW: mentions of eating/my weight.
Title probably sounds weird. I want to note that I have not been diagnosed with an eating disorder, but there are mentions of bad eating habits and my weight here, so Iâ€™ll put a little warning here in case that could trigger you in any way.

I have always been a very petite girl, and as a child I used to be a very picky eater - which probably added to me being very thin.

As I grew a little older, however, it got much easier! I didnâ€™t gain any weight, but I didnâ€™t have any trouble eating a lot. I could eat a full meal and still be able to eat multiple sandwiches afterwards, for instance.

But this year, something changed. I had an appetite loss like crazy which I think first surfaced because of my stress at school, and then it just got worse with time. I didnâ€™t starve myself, but I pretty much only ate dinner and drank tea/coffee during the days, occasionally eating a sandwich or apple maybe. Or a small meal like noodles. But that was it. It was only because I didnâ€™t feel hungry, so I basically ate a whole lot of dinner but very little during the days.

But then I realized that it made me feel like shit and I lost more weight. So I decided to try to change that again.

It took some time, but today I was able to eat many small meals (fruits, sandwiches, eggs etc.) during the entire day, and finish off with a pretty big meal in the evening. Iâ€™m so proud of myself for doing that, so I wanted to share it ðŸ¥º

It made me so happy â¤ï¸â¤ï¸",0
"Whenever I look at myself and go on a scale, I feel too skinny and underweight. Itâ€™s really hard for me to eat a whole bunch of things.

"I was a chemist for 5 years and absolutely hated it. Tried working at other places but the job just didnâ€™t interest me at all. Finally found a field I was excited about getting into.

"*obligatory ""I'm on mobile"" ""English isn't my first language"" mention*

I don't really know if this is the right sub for that. I just feel overly happy and I want to share it, the same way one would evacuate his anger in one big rant.

So, there's this girl in my uni. We have friends in common so I see her sometimes at parties, we played in a rpg together, we're in good terms overall but nothing to write home about, really.

There's this week where we go every evening to different bars, to give an opportunity for the newcomers at the uni to meet the other students. Of course I went, and of course she went.

Yesterday evening, I might have drank just a little bit. She went to ask me a question when she was leaving and (I'm certain there was a logical reason but I can't remember it) I ended up telling her that yeah, she's a great person and I would love to get to know her. She didn't really reacted. 

I realized during the night that it was a dumb move on my part. I don't know what I was expecting.

Today, I spend most of the evening acting like yesterday never happened. We were cordial but I didn't wanted to get back on the topic. There was nothing more to say, right?

Anyways I drank a bit again and I was here challenging people to arm wrestling. I don't know why, but I asked her, and she accepted. We had had to move in a corner of the bar to find a suitable table to do it. I won and we started discussing about gender roles or whatever. Anyways, she brought up what I said yesterday. I comfort her that I took some time to think it through, and it was just me forgetting to just shut the fuck up and she shouldn't worry about it. She asked me ""why?"" I told her that I don't know what I was expecting, going to her while not really knowing her first.

She told me that she felt the same, kinda attracted but she would like to get to know me better first.

If that's not a girl asking you to a date I don't know what is.

Anyways, after this bar marathon is over, we plan to have a date together and see where it goes.

I'm just fucking happy because we played a rpg together for a year. If she saw me yell about my Dream Body spell while making mildly offensive jokes about cat people in Tamriel and still think ""I find this man attractive"", then I know I can be myself with her and it won't be a problem.

What makes me smile like an idiot is that, when she finally went to leave, I told her ""see you tomorrow"", and ""I can't wait to see you again"". And she fucking said ""me too"" with that cute shy smile after a second. Every time I think about it my heart melts a little more. She's precious and I can't wait to see her again.",0

"This is just an update to anyone who even gives a shit as to how Iâ€™m doing. Since my last r/happy post I have moved, and Iâ€™m enjoying my new hometown, even if it is filled with boomers :p. All kidding aside, itâ€™s quiet, thereâ€™s absolutely no crime, streets are clean, I can comfortably walk to the beach and chill and eat a burger or schnitzel, and best of all I got this new fridge where Iâ€™m GUARANTEED cubed ice now!!! :D. It was just fucking awful when there was this really god awful heat wave back in June (got up to 105 degrees) and I literally had to take this big bag of ice and smack it to try and separate themâ€¦ what a time that was!!! Also on a side note I didnâ€™t realize room temperature Coke fizzed that much when it hit ice lmao. Also on the note of my new house, some of my extended family came over to see it and we all went in the pool in our backyard for a swim, that was a total blast as I havenâ€™t seen them since my Grandmaâ€™s funeral a year ago.

On the other hand, all my favorite things to do have come back right around now, car shows are back, motorsports are back, football is back, and Iâ€™m just thrilled that I can just kick back and enjoy life and see peopleâ€™s smiles again! And *everyone* is smiling just as I predicted! Iâ€™m sure Reddit can agree that last year was perhaps the most dark depressing time of our entire lifetime but hey we all kept up the faith and we stuck through! And trust me, there were times where I was so goddamn depressed throughout all of last year and most of this year where I felt like ending my life as it just got so stressful. Iâ€™m glad that I stuck it out, as my patience is now being rewarded! 

I honestly think that 2022 will be the happiest year in recent history. Anyways to whoever reads this I hope you have a great day and hereâ€™s to much more fun and excitement in 2022! :D",0

Ten years ago I never thought I would be a dad, never thought I would be married, never thought I'd have a career that wasn't retail. She felt the same.

"Hello! Iâ€™m so excited about this I have to tell someone. So my SO and I are long distance, been together for three years. A lot of how we hang out is over playing video games, which I love playing with them. I have a decent PC yet theirs wasnâ€™t the greatest, and unfortunately their PC blue screened and they couldnâ€™t really afford to fix it.
So I decided to save up my money and buy them a really nice laptop. Specs wise itâ€™s better then mine, so they can even play the games I can like Witcher and Cyberpunk. The journey their was tough especially since I work a very physical job. As well as online pricing continuing to rise every single time my paycheck came around, however I finally managed to get them it!!

Then I began to study to be a lab technician, and it has been hard on my first year there, lots of failed experiments that got me serverly demotivated, but today I made two experiments parallel to each other, one was one part of a larger experiment while my lab partner made the other half. We had troubles with some enzymes, and I volunteered to make an experiment to figure out which enzyme was defect. Lots of prep work and lots to focus on, but the results was so satisfying! My teacher was pleased, and I was so happy that I got tears in my eyes.

I managed to keep a cool head, while I was still helping others. This success was so needed!

"My girlfriend is a nurse and works three twelve hour overnight shifts in a row during the week. She lives in Seattle while I am in Portland. We take turns visiting over the weekend at each other's homes. When I first met her, I had switched up my schedule to wake up at 5am to go to the gym and work on my MA before going on with my day. I was having difficulty keeping to the regime and when I told her, she promised to make sure I got up every day at 5am and to hold me accountable to get these things done. Every day for the last six weeks, that is what she has done, whether it be to call me during one of her shifts, or setting her alarm to wake up when I would wake up. Four weeks ago she started sending me a coffee via Uber Eats or making me one when I finished my gym routine and whatever I needed to do with my MA for the day.

They say it's the small things that matter in relationships, not necessarily the big gestures or grand proclamations of love. I've found with her it's true. There's so many other thing little things she does and they speak so much in volume about her. I had a stressful meeting with a venture capitalist over the weekend and she wrote on a sticky note, ""You got this! :),"" putting if on my laptop. I only noticed it as I was pulling out my laptop and sitting down for the meeting. She just smiled and winked at me before leaving the room. I just came back from a booking today to find Panda Express on my porch from her... she's pulling overtime today with extra twelve hour shift and she still found the time to send me some freaking food because I hadn't eaten anything yet today. At this point, I am astutely and thoroughly blown away by her. I am pretty much head over heels in love with her at this point. The size of her heart is only outmatched by the size of her brain and my want to keep her laughing at my lame ass puns until she is hoarse.",0

"I've dealt with extreme social anxiety for years. This year I decided to join a club at my college to get out of my comfort zone but I wasn't expecting to make any friends. Yesterday at the club meeting I introduced myself to this girl, which is already a HUGE accomplishment for me. It was a little awkward at first but we soon found common interests and we just stuck together for the rest of the club since we're both pretty shy. I'm looking forward to seeing her again next week and it makes me so happy to have made a friend!",0
"So, I was browsing Reddit a day or so ago when I stumbled upon a subreddit called r/RoleReversal. I just love the idea of being with a nice strong assertive girl. The idea just makes me feel so safe and secure. Playing the supportive role and encouraging them to achieve their goals sounds so wonderful. Maybe one day such a wonderful girl will find me, but at least I finally found the term that describes what I want in a relationship. :)",0
Some girls walked up to me and asked for my insta. Struck up a convo through DMs and theyâ€™re pretty cool. I feel good about myself tonight,0
"My boyfriend sometimes sleeptalks sweet nothings and doesnâ€™t recall it whatsoever the next morning. Itâ€™s usually that he loves me or that Iâ€™m pretty, just silly sleep babble. 

Earlier today I got let go from my biggest contract (and my last â€œreal jobâ€ other than working for myself) so experiencing some financial anxiety though Iâ€™m ready to take the leap into being fully self-employed. Itâ€™s nerve-racking but exciting.

Iâ€™m up later than usual stressing about it. My boyfriend is sound asleep and he just rolled over, cuddled me and saidâ€” â€œhey beautiful â€” donâ€™t worry. Iâ€™m going to take care of you and I believe in you.â€ 

Just so sweet and so pure to have a partner who is such a grounding influence through life changes ðŸ’• and who believes in me even when heâ€™s sound asleep!",0
I have several physical and mental health disabilities Animal Crossing has been my go to since it came out for when Iâ€™m depressed. Mine was stolen and sold for an ex friends drug habit. Someone from a group exclusively for Animal Crossing is sending me a new one free of charge. Iâ€™m currently waiting in the hospital for a new place to live since I escaped an abusive environment.

"I have a personal goal of squatting 315 lbs for six reps. Two months ago I could only do 195lbs. Tonight I just did 305!!!!! AAAAAAAAAA I'm so excited!!!!

"Iâ€™ve always been a huge worrier with an inferiority complex. Iâ€™d think things like, â€œIâ€™m smart, but not smart enough.â€ Or â€œmy college degree means nothingâ€ or â€œI wish I could do that but I know I canâ€™t.â€
Then one day recently, it just clickedâ€”I can do anything if I want it bad enough. All I have to do is try my very best. Give it a valiant effort. And if I fail, I can fix my mistake and try again. Failure is okay. It happens to everyone, and it doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™re stupid or incapable.
I didnâ€™t think I could get a job in a different stateâ€”I did. I didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d ever save as much as I currently have. I didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d ever find an apartment I loved that I could actually affordâ€”well, I did that too.
Iâ€™m just very excited. Iâ€™m constantly on Target and Amazon looking for things I want to put in my apartment. ðŸ˜‚ Iâ€™ve joined a group chat of other ladies in my new city and weâ€™re already planning activities! Who knew that this depressed and anxious introvert could accomplish so much? It used to seem impossible. Iâ€™m obviously a little scared to move so far away on my own for the first time but Iâ€™m so excited to see what type of life I can create for myself.",0

"So I've been playing football for 5 years.Our coach has his son on our team,and his sister is really pretty.She's 16 or 17 btw but I'm 14.
I realized I had a crush on her last year but I didn't say anything of course.But whenever I go to my coaches house I get butterflies when I see her lol
Our team destroyed our opponent in our first game of the year,and I must say that I had a great game lol
After it was over and I was hanging out with some teammates,she strolled up to us and talked about the game for a bit
She then smiled at me and stared at me for a few seconds and randomly said ""Dang,you sure are growing up and are getting really good looking""
I turned beat red and my heart raced and finally managed to awkwardly thank her
The other kids laughed and she said your welcome to me lol
My life is good",0
"Early this morning I had the worst anxiety attack about my life and thinking what's the point. I've dealt with depression for so long I can't even remember what it feels to naturally be happy. I also seem to always have negative thoughts and thinking super down about myself and things around me. I really could use help and guidance in terms of things to watch, read or do to at least get me on track. 

I was on effexor for 2 years, but wanted to get off due to some of the side effects and once I finally got off after lower each dose I thought I was going to start feeling better which seems to be the opposite. I don't know if the right thing to do is go back on medicine (specifically an antidepressant) but I really need advice and help :(",0
"Well Reddit, after a year and a half of being unemployed I think I finally have gotten a job, from my understanding I start training on Monday at a local coffee shop.

It DOES get better. Just wait and see.",0
"I wanted to put this down into words, and share it. I can feel myself all at once just coming into my own. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s started, I donâ€™t know when it was. But something has happened where Iâ€™ve suddenly snapped, come out of my shell, and Iâ€™ve never felt more motivated in my life. Iâ€™m ready to go to the gym tomorrow and make a real change. Iâ€™m ready to go to college in two weeks and finally earn something more than GCSEs after 2 years of dropping college and sixth form. It feels like somehow, somewhere, a huge weight has been lifted off my back. Yesterday I spoke to my oldest sister over a phone call for the first time in half a year. It was a huge leap of faith. I had no conversation topics pre thought up, no alterations to my language, no trying to be the best. Iâ€™d seen a sentence about dancing, how if you just focus on feeling it instead of thinking of the steps in your head, it works. And it worked. And we spoke for 2 and a half hours, effortlessly just talking. I havenâ€™t had a conversation like that in years, where Iâ€™ve just been able to relax. I canâ€™t put it into words at all. All I can say is when something happens thatâ€™s incredible, Iâ€™ll be adding it to this post. Whether itâ€™s a week, month or year from now. I love you all.",0

"My whole life I have been hyper-critical of myself, and I think I have undiagnosed ADHD. My confidence in myself is shot. I had a bad graduate school experience where my advisor always shot me down, and I was convinced I was useless in this profession I have loved and been studying toward since I was a kid. Then covid happened and everything seemed even more hopeless. I was depressed and feeling very lost; I was even thinking about giving up music to pursue something easier with better pay. Then I was spontaneously offered my dream job by a mentor I once had. No application or interview, because they believed in me that much. All I had to do was sign the contract. I'm pretty young and inexperienced, but they have so much faith in me. That has to mean I have some value, right?

I start this week, and so far I have gotten to work with and form a colleague relationship with this person, who has been my idol for a decade. They inspired me to become a musician and pursue my dreams in the first place. I feel like I couldn't even dream up a better scenario for myself. I am just over the moon. My existence feels meaningful and validated. What do I even do with all of this gratitude?? 

While I am terrified of ruining it and the job is really nothing huge, it's big to me. I can't believe I have this opportunity and can't help but feel the universe has my back in some weird way.

"I'm an Italian volounteer working in France for an association that helps young people without family to get indipendent.

They're mostly migrants from Africa and Arab countries that need housing, getting regular documents to legally stay in the country, finish their studies and find a work.

Due to Covid we didn't do many activities and we were left with some extra budget, so we decided to spend it for a trip, and yesterday we brought them to the beach. We were a dozen: seven teenagers from several african countries, three from Pakistan, me, and an educator. As soon as we arrived we immediately went into the water.

Me, being a little thin and suffering the cold from the water more than other people, got out earlier than the others and went back where we left our stuff. Not a minute after I got there, a guy came to me asking something. It went like that:

Him: Are you supervising that group there? (pointing at my young ones playing in the water)

Me: Yes

At that point I expected some kind of bad remark. And instead.

Him: We are leaving tomorrow, and I wanted to give you this to spend for getting them ice creams

And he lent me a 50 euros banknote. I didn't really know what to reply on the spot, and just told him a ""thank you"", very surprised. He didn't wait for more, and just left. He had his towel a little further, he packed his stuff, was joined by who I guess were his wife and daughter, and went away.

He didn't ask if I was working for some association, who the young ones I was supervising were, nothing. He didn't even wait for giving the money when everyone was present. He just made this selfless act and departed.

On the way back we bought everyone ice creams and I ended the day with a really great feeling. I think it was the nicest, most spontaneous thing I ever happened to see from someone.",0

Tonight I danced with my teen daughter in a Walmart parking lot. There was a man drumming so we came and danced. I asked him why Heâ€™s said heâ€™s from Africa and he has been diagnosed with depression and ptsd. Music makes him happy so he uses it as therapy. A woman and her young daughter watched us. I yelled come dance and the little girl did. It was magical. He sang Youâ€™re my angel to us. I am not an extrovert and Iâ€™m always worried about what people think. I hope tonight people think that crazy lady dancing to a strangers drum looked happy. It was what my soul needed.,0
"Birthday

Have had a plan to celebrate my birthday this week to make up for the fact I didnâ€™t have a proper 21st, and I donâ€™t want to drunk text my friends and think this appreciation is only out of being under the influence. But I just want everyone to know having friends who genuinely support you and want to see you succeed is so amazing. I NEED the best for all of my friends period. Knowing I have the support from them as well in whatever venture I take is so heartwarming. 

Get friends who are confident and are confident in you. 

Itâ€™s so nice being at peace with yourself knowing you have a group of people who want the best for eachother. It takes a while to find these people but cherish it. I used to never see a point to life and wanted to end it all for the longest amount of time because I didnâ€™t see a pointâ€¦ and I can see where people come from in hopelessness, give it time you will find your people. You will find your group that all supports eachother. You will find meaning to keep going, you may not find the reason but you will find why and who to keep going for to support them and to have them support you is amazing. Just give it TIME. I really never thought I would find this point in my life but man does it feel amazing to regret every single negative thought about life I ever had. I hope everyone finds this. I want everyone to reach this point of appreciation towards who they have in their life.
They tried to remove me for a vague title yeaYEA YEA WE WILL SEE ABOUT THAT .",0
"So basically last year I was feeling a bit low. I really didnâ€™t know how to become better since I had never faced this before. I used to not get proper sleep and woke up after having dreams due to my anxiety. So I just started noting what activities I did and whom I did it with in a google doc. Slowly I also started rating how I felt about the interaction. Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. I stopped dreaming as frequently since then. I even built an app for this so that other people can do the same .

The app is called Happyer which was made based on the above experience and provides insights into impact of a given activity or friend. The app also has a ""Find Therapist"" feature using which you can contact our therapists for help.

"This afternoon my boyfriend (17M) and I (17F) found out we would be on our schools homecoming court, and it felt so surreal! I had to keep looking at the announcement post over and over to make sure I wasnâ€™t dreaming! For some context, weâ€™re both seniors and were one of four couples most voted out of around 12+ couples! It makes me really happy, because Iâ€™m a shy, mostly introverted kid, and I have a lot of social anxiety, and itâ€™s just really good to have a sort ofâ€¦validation from my peers, you know? Although I also owe a lot of it to my boyfriend, heâ€™s really outgoing and charming, I donâ€™t think I couldâ€™ve ever gained the confidence to do this without him! Iâ€™m super excited for the homecoming game now, Iâ€™m determined to make my senior year the best yet!

Itâ€™s funny too, we were supposed to find out who was on the court last Friday, but due to technical issues (they left one of the couples off the ballot) and ties (apparently four couples tied for second place! Isnâ€™t that crazy?!) we had to revote today! I was anxious my entire class after voting, but it felt so good to see our names there!

If you donâ€™t mind me getting mushy, I really appreciate my boyfriend a lot and am so excited to get to do this with him. We both had really bad previous relationships, and it was something we bonded over. He treats me so well, he likes to show me off, is always loving to me, and I can tell him anything! I canâ€™t express just how much I appreciate him, because I really do. He even bought me a froggy bucket hat that he gave me earlier today! Honestly, my day has just been really amazing, and I hope yours is too!",0
"I work for the Canada Revenue Agency, been there 2.5 years. When you start, you're generally thrown into the collections department or some other place nobody wants to be.

I was doing ok for a while and even got selected to work a more advanced workload after several months. Then the pandemic happened and I've been thrown all over the Agency, I'm thankful they kept me employed while collections was halted, but it derailed my learning progression. I've been worried a lot recently about my productivity since coming back to collections, I need ground up re-training to function at this point.

Then a miracle happened, my Team Leader announced to us that a different department is expanding and will be filled by officers in my current role. I put my name in and I've been accepted. I don't know when I start training, though it will be sooner rather than later they say. The bottom line is, I finally get to leave collections. For the first time in 4 years I'm going to actually enjoy my job I think.",0

But I gave the situation some space and sent her an olive branch three days ago. Today I was pleasantly surprised with a response!

"This story may drag on a little but I have never done this and I want to talk about it to someone. 

I got my first car yesterday. Itâ€™s a wagon of crap, but hey, itâ€™s MY wagon of crap. I took my girlfriend for a drive for the first time last night and I took her to a peak that looks over our town. It was pretty dark and we were driving to some quiet music and we couldnâ€™t get the smiles off our faces if we tried to. She bought a Polaroid camera, one of those ones that print instantly and she had it with her, being all retro. She wanted to take a photo of me with the car, and she told me that Iâ€™d thank her one day. So she did and I realised I wanted one of her, just for me. I took the camera out of her hands and asked if I could get a photo of her and she let me. Boys, let me tell you, those eyes are tattooed across my memory. I got the photo and I asked if I could keep it, just for me. She said I could if I really wanted to, not realising how important she is. And now Iâ€™ve got it. And I keep that photo in my cap. I was actually debating whether to keep it in the mirror that folds up on the ceiling of the car, but I quite like having it in my hat. A photo of the two things I love. My girl and my car.",0

I never interact with them or tell her I see them cause she knows I only go on Twitter to reply to her and Iâ€™m afraid sheâ€™ll stop if she knows I see them but it warms my heart when she does :),0
"Hi! I am a 15 year old teenager who became introspective and self-aware about himself. I am from a very unstable family. When I was in 7th grade I had suicidal thoughts, feelings that my problems would go on and on and will not stop, hated myself. But then I realized, I had an ambition, I always thought of saving somebody from suicide and changing the lives of others. I always wanted to become a psychotherapist, and write philosophical stuff, theories on my personal diary of thoughts which I hide.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was in 7th-8th grade I was kind of a people pleaser. Too naÃ¯ve, tried to see the good in all, repressed my anger in order to avoid conflicts, didn't know when things are going too far. But then in 9th grade, I realized that boundaries must be created.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents are not really good parents, my mom is emotionally unstable, very bossy, sometimes gets mad randomly, while my dad constantly invalidates my feelings and gaslights me. I cannot get in therapy, they think its useless, both of them constantly fights, there is no more understanding/ agreement between them. My mom is very manipulative towards my dad, threatens to leave us if she didn't get what she want, then my dad would get scared and follow anyways. Convinced them to get to family therapy, didn't work, they think its a waste of time, they never really understood that relationships could recover beautifully even if I told them that. I told my dad the repressed anger and sadness I have been keeping for years, ended up getting told to just accept it, got invalidated. I know that my parents are not perfect in raising me, nobody is perfect.

&amp;#x200B;

Someday in the future, I will heal myself from this trauma and now I just have to endure that I am from a very dysfunctional family. I usually just vent to my best friends or online. I really want to move out and go to a university, currently in grade 10, only 2 more years. Cant really make new friends or go out due to the pandemic, its very strict here. So I just have to message or video call my previous friends that I trust.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that this will probably follow me through my adulthood due to the fact that I never really felt loved, so I daydream every night about finding someone who would accept me for who I am, understand me, help me grow and mature as a person. But then I realized, I have myself, I know that I am an amazing and a lovable person who deserves to be loved. People have told me I am soft hearted, open minded, a great listener, never invalidates, intelligent, and not a judgmental person. I confirmed what they said because I finally know my mindset after allowing time for myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**This is how I learnt how to love and know myself:**

&amp;#x200B;

**I identified the positive things about me in which I truly believe in, regardless of what some people say**

&amp;#x200B;

I am soft hearted and kind because of my ambitions on becoming a psychotherapist, helping people heal themselves, save people. I know I cant save every person, help the world, but saving one would mean the world to them.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I am a great listener and open minded, because I would often listen with an open mind and an open heart. I don't invalidate because I believe that the person that can know you the most is yourself, you shouldn't just brush it off, tell that there are many other problems. I empathize.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I am not judgmental because I have this mindset where I view people like a spectrum between bad and good. I believe everyone has flaws and it is up to us if we are going to accept them or not depending on the severity of their traits. I know that every behavior has a reason so I should be open and know from their perspective. Sometimes people deserve to be forgiven, but I usually don't talk to them afterwards but remove grudges.

&amp;#x200B;

2nd:

&amp;#x200B;

**I identified the negative traits about me and determined if I should improve it or accept it.**

&amp;#x200B;

I know I am a person who can take a lot of personal stuff from people, very giving, too kind and naÃ¯ve. But now I know that I have attracted a lot of toxic people. I focused more on myself and decided to cut them all out and keep the ones who I feel like I can trust and are decent and genuinely wants me to be happy and okay. I learnt that its better to have a few close friends than to have a lot of friends. Started realizing when I was in 8th grade. **(Improvement)**

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing, I daydream a lot, I can sometimes be very unaware of my surroundings which annoys my parents but I accept that, it gives me insights about life, makes me know more things deeply, gives me encouragement and hope. **(Acceptance)**

&amp;#x200B;

That's all, I know for a fact this will follow me from adulthood, but it would be my responsibility to heal myself, I know that I have myself, me and my friends may someday stop reconnecting but I know that I have and I love myself. Someday I hope to find the one who will love me, help me for more improvement. IDK if I would forgive my parents because I realized that parents are not perfect in raising a child. I just have to focus on endurance, acceptance, and maturity for 2 more years.",0
I honestly thought I wouldn't make top 5 but they just announced the results and I'm going insane! I tied for the position but it honestly means the world to me and my family and I wanted to share my joy!,0
"After all these years of being insecure and basing my looks and feelings and morals from other people and having horrible anxiety, I have finally become a better, healthier person. Am I perfect? No. Is my mental health perfect? Of course not. But Iâ€™m finally confident, and I have gotten so many compliments saying Iâ€™ve gotten so confident and to keep it up. I have more friends than ever. Iâ€™m so happy!",0
"Millions of us call happiness their lifelong goal. But few define what happiness means, often leading us to chase what our parents, friends, and role models defined as happiness. So when we are back to wearing diapers, we realize we ignored everything we genuinely esteemed.

In my experience studying dozens of happiness frameworks and science-backed studies about happiness, I've found the best chance at being happy at any time comes from defining what happiness isn't. It's like an inverse happiness checklist.

In it, you write what doesn't bring you joy and then ensure your current pursuit of happiness, whether it is to travel the world or become wealthy, doesn't include any of the items from the checklist.Â 

The inverse checklist serves two purposes: it helps define happiness and tells you which activities to remove from your life.

So, for example, if you conclude money doesn't bring joy. But you work from 9-9 because ""hustle is life,"" then reduce the number of, say, side projects you have. Otherwise, you'll be frustrated after reaching financial ""freedom"" and likely feelÂ physically and mentally exhausted.

Each person's definition of happiness varies. However, most people can include specific items into their inverse checklist to define happiness.

## Your definition of happiness cannot reject distress

We can't control the decisions and behaviors of humans, animals, or nature. Otherwise, hurricanes and phone thieves wouldn't exist. So no matter the statistical formula you use to predict events or the number of possible scenarios you draw on your whiteboard, potential sources of unhappiness are always around the corner.Â 

To avoid the discomfort from harmful events, some people write a list of sources of distress and eliminate them from their life. For example, they quit their job to run from their nerve-racking boss. Or switch majors. The issue with this list is its potential sizeâ€”it's infinite because any event in our lives can distress us.

A more efficient solution is to invite distress into your life. And realizing happiness can coexist with events that don't match our definition of a perfect activity, day, or life. For example, a harmless event like Microsoft Word crashing before letting you save an article could either ruin your day. Or it could become a fun challenge to overcome.

When you welcome distress, you experience two benefits. First, you become used to different causes of discomfort, reducing their chances of affecting you. Second, you realize distress can (and must) coexist with happiness.Â  Â 

## Your definition of happiness cannot come from others

Most of us chase a definition of happiness that other people set for us, leading to repentance during our deathbed. For example, some people accumulate academic titles to impress their parents, while others seek minimalism according to a monk's advice.Â 

In college, psychologists, doctors, and nurses taught me around 80% of older people underÂ palliative careÂ regretted their lives' choices. But you don't need wrinkles or to be in a hospital to regret your life. So instead, change it today.Â 

First, write down a list of scenarios that would bring happiness to your life. You can then describe the benefits of each scenario and the barriers between you and them. Second, answer the most crucial question: ""who's someone in my life who believes this scenario would bring happiness?""Â 

Ask yourself one last question: ""Is this goal worth pursuing even though X person shares it?""Â 

Contrast your answer with other items from your checklist. So if you think happiness is living amongst your friends in the countryside (goal), your friends feel the same (influence), but your inverse checklist says youÂ *don't*Â like being away from the city, then stop pursuing that goal.

## Avoid being miserable on your deathbed.

While your DNA differs from the millions of people who have regretted their life's choices on their deathbeds, you may be following another person's definition of happinessâ€”just like they did. Unfortunately, the old and sick don't have the strength to change their lives drastically. But you do.Â 

So start developing today a definition of happiness your elderly self will accept, oneÂ *you*Â truly believe.Â

"I turned 25 years old, 3 days ago. 
My boyfriend and I celebrated by going to Disneyland and Universal Studios. 
My last day at my current job is the 27th and I start my new job on the 30th. 
I am in the healthiest relationship Iâ€™ve ever been in and Iâ€™m absolutely in love. 
We have a beautiful home together. 
We have a healthy and sweet Golden Retriever who I love so much. 
Iâ€™ve been seeing my new therapist for over 5 months and Iâ€™ve made so much progress with her and she sincerely cares about my well being. 
I have great and supportive friends and family. 

Iâ€™m genuinely just blessed. Iâ€™ve spent a very large portion of my life depressed and feeling hopeless but for the first time in a long time I see life in a much happier and hopeful light.",0
yeah basically what the title says. I did it like an hour ago. i told her i liked her and she just looked at me and smiled and then i smiled and then we both laughed and then she said she likes me too and then we hugged and oh god that hug was amazing and then she had to go so i just stood there celebrating and now im on cloud nine and there's this warm fuzzy ball of happiness inside me and i have this big goofy smile on my face and yeah thats about it.,0
"I live in a beautiful city that most people vacation in.
I finally went back to school full time for a degree I think ill enjoy.
I can fully support myself without working at all and don't rely on anyone to take care of me. 
I have more than I ever imagine I would in life. I really didn't think I would be ""alright"". My parents even told me they had almost no hope for me and didn't think I'd make anything of myself. 
I have done well enough in 10 years that I'll never be forced to work again unless I decide I want to. I have no idea how I even managed that as it was never my intention. 
I looked in the mirror this morning and couldn't stop smiling.
 I feel so blessed and am so proud of myself for never letting anyone stop me or hold me back. 
I'm so happy.",0
"For context, albeit brief, I grew up in a narcissistic household with absentee parents. I more or less raised myself, an only child, and figured out everything the hard way. I never really fit in anywhere and found out after I turned 18 that I have Asperger's Syndrome, which explained a lot of things. Today I'm 32, turning 33 in a week, married, and working on some baby making.

I didn't realize it until I met my wife, but I was a generally and consistently unhappy person. I first realized it when my wife was always super happy to see me but I felt dead inside. It really started to come out after we started living together. I never really saw the good in anything. I was happy to be with her and obviously I love her, but from her point of view I was dead. Seeing her slump into sadness whenever she felt there was nothing she could do to help me (I didn't even realize she was trying) hit home for me.

I sought help.

I saw a psych and they prescribed bupropion and adderall. Not long after I realized how limited my frame of reference was, how little I took time to get to know myself and nurture myself, and how bad things were internally for me.

The first signpost was when my wife and my father in law were spending time together and my wife, speaking to her dad, told him how much more active I've been and how happy the dogs have been to spend time with me instead of trying to coddle me. I didn't realize those were issues. He then replied that he can tell I have a noticeable spring in my step and I'm a lot more talkative.

The second signpost happened this morning. I don't remember what happened to prompt this, but I started going through my subs and leaving a ton of subreddits that, while at the time I thought were humorous such as r/trashy or r/IdiotsNearlyDying, I just couldn't stomach anymore. I left a LOT of subs this morning. I looked back over my sub list to make sure I didn't miss anything and I realize I just cut out a huge chunk of negativity in my life. Without realizing it, I was done with the things I'd scroll through every day that were innately negative or depressing and only wanted to see things that made me smile, were uplift, informative, or cool.

I recently spoke with and received approval from my wife to attend a discovery flight before signing up for flight school to get my private pilot's license. Without knowing me this won't have the right context, but three years ago that kind of action and momentum wasn't in my wheelhouse. Today I fly RC planes, flight sim with every moment I can steal, and have found hobbies and interests that really do come from the soul for me. These days I know myself, and every day I'm learning more and more about what makes me tick.

I use to be a depressed mess destined for mediocrity. I made the choice to do better. Today I'm an interesting, amazing, wonderful husband, future father, fur baby daddy, and lifelong friend to myself.

Life is good.",0
"I live across the ocean from my home country and it's very isolating. I always felt so alone. Recently I have come to my country and visiting aunts, cousins, siblings that I have no contact with and they all tell me to not exclude myself. Even cousins that I haven't had much contact in my life have told me that they want to know how I'm doing and so and so. I never knew they cared about me like this. Im going through a break up from an abusive relationship and hearing about how they value me as a person makes me happy. I dont know how to explain but it really gives me comfort. I have been so down before that I had to be hospitalized for a week and I felt that no one cared, but I know that it's not the truth. Family is the most important to me and I feel glad that these people want to be apart of my life. The support I am receiving and people that are listening to me and understanding my side and telling me that they want the best for me, that they know I deserve better is overwhelming great. I feel like before people gaslighted the shit out of me, saying I was making a big deal out of nothing and things like that. To not be laughed at is amazing. It feels a lot easier to let go of my traumas with the support I am receiving.",0
"guys i fell in love. head over heels jumping off the diving board in love! and i think our story is pretty cool :)
i (17f) started sixth form at a new school in september 2020. i have a friend (17m), letâ€™s call him timmy, who goes to that school. for the sake of the story weâ€™re going to call my boyfriend adam (17m). before i started at this new school, timmy warned me against this boy. he told me â€œthereâ€™s a boy called adam, he WILL try and get with you, donâ€™t do itâ€. iâ€™d heard of adam before as him and timmy were really close friends so it shocked me when timmy â€˜warnedâ€™ me against him. he elaborated, telling me that adam had talked to many girls in the past and it had always ended badly. he told me that his relationships never last very long, and the girls he usually gets with are timmys friends, and so it ends awkwardly. so it comes to september, and i finally meet adam. heâ€™s an absolute god. confident,attractive,funny and we quickly exchanged snapchatâ€™s. only, iâ€™d totally forgotten about what timmy told me. i only remembered when multiple girls who disliked adam had noticed we were flirting and told me not to be with him. i heard story upon story (some of which werenâ€™t true) about adams past and it was as if everyone was against us ever being a thing. meanwhile, i was coming to like him more and more. on november 16 after 2 months of overnight facetime calls and afterschool mcdonaldâ€™s dates , he asked me to be his girlfriend and i said yes with no hesitation. itâ€™s been nine months and i can honestly say that iâ€™m so glad i didnâ€™t let anyone come between us. everyday he makes me feel like a princess and i just feel like my life is pieces together with him in it. i know what youâ€™re thinking. young love never lasts. but i donâ€™t want a future without this boy. nothing makes sense without him, and i hope everyone can find this love at some point in their lives. thanks for reading :)",0
today i (F19) am 19 ðŸ¤ ngl iâ€™m crying bc so many times i just wanted God to take me early. even just a few days ago i felt like that. but iâ€™m glad i made it to 19. iâ€™m very blessed,0
"He cooked me breakfast this morning, I thought it was going to be like any other day. After breakfast he comes up to me and starts telling me how happy he is to be with me and how much he is looking forward to our future...it was very out of character for him so I knew something was up. Then out of the corner of my eye I see him grab a bag of cat treats and he calls my cat, who is the biggest love of my life lol, and he had the ring tied around a string on her neck. So he literally got my cat to propose! It was adorable and I am so happy. The ring doesn't fit but he gave me his mother's wedding ring (his dad has passed) which made it even more special. I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with this man and I just wanted to share the news!!",0
"I got the job after 3 years of freelancing because of mental health issues.

The job is animation team leader, it's basically a dream job for me and I've been doing overtime just because I love it so much.

I've always loved my job and being an animator, but it's the first time for me to be this happy and I never imagined that I could enjoy my job even more than before.

I'm doing my best but I had doubts about my performance, but today so many people praised how well I fit the job, how much they like my style of leadership, how well I fit within the team, how fast I got involved in everything, my boss was also happy about it and most importantly my team had nothing but good things to say about me.

I'm a bit tough and blunt so I worried that they might be upset about my way of giving feedback, but the senior animator expressed that he liked that I'm straight to the point and didn't see it as a bad thing.

I'm so happy that I can't stop thinking about it, I never imagined that I'd be here and that I'd achieve this much in such a short time.

TLDR, I'm kicking ass at my new job despite my worries",0
"Over the summer I took an online course that my school offered so I wouldnâ€™t have to take it during my senior year. It was about $200 but in my opinion, worth it. I procrastinated all the way up till tonight where I did all of it in a matter of 7-8 hours non-stop. I genuinely thought I should just give it up and cut my losses but I kept on going. Iâ€™ve never been so exhausted in my life and I just turned in my final exam 3 mins before the deadline (I got a 94 :D)

Would I do this again? Absolutely not, I shouldâ€™ve just spread out the work over the 2 months. Iâ€™m just glad this huge mountain has been lifted from my shoulders. Now itâ€™s time to forget everything I learned.",0
"Itâ€™s been 20 years since I have been truly happy and myself. I feel proud of myself getting to happy again. I am grateful to not be blinded by my sadness to see how great I have it and how clear I can see I have the most amazing people in my life forever. 

I was raised insanely healthy with no abuse or trauma. I still have a very healthy, loving, accepting and supportive family. I am one of the lucky ones. The more I am an adult, the more I see how rare my loving, healthy upbringing was. I denied it and went against it until I went out into the world and saw how sad, painful and hurt the environment and people are to others. 

I am sorry. You never deserved all that pain.",0
"Today I got off probation after 10 years

To some this might not be a huge thing but I finally got the news that I am finally off probation. I had a nasty drug habit so I often found myself in handcuffs rightfully so. I was never violent, no sexual charges and nothing crazy in my history. I would steal from Walmart and sell stuff I stole. I racked up 3 petty larceny charges all under $80 and became a felon. Spent 1 year in jail and since then on probation. I never had a dirty drug test, kept a full time job and only encountered cops when I ended up catching speeding tickets. 

Iâ€™ve been on probation since I was 17 and itâ€™s been the biggest weight when it comes to finding jobs or just feeling normal. People just look at me different when Iâ€™d say â€œIâ€™m a non violent/sexual felon on probation. Been fired multiple times when people â€œfeared being around a felonâ€â€¦ I know I did dumb shit but I paid for those mistakes. 

I feel like I just won the lottery. I can finally just be â€œregularâ€. My felony is easily able to be expunged and right now I canâ€™t explain this feeling. I donâ€™t have anybody to celebrate this with and I just needed to vent this excitement. I hope everybody who reads this has a good day because mine just got better.",0
I turned 21 today ! So far itâ€™s been excellent. I had a pina colada and it was pretty delicious if I do say so myself! I will admit I was very scared to ask for a drink. Haha ! Just had to share my excitement with someone besides the people I celebrated today with! ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³,0
"For context I'm as dumb as a rock, I didn't take school seriously at all and it set me back quite a bit, especially where maths is concered.

So I'm playing fantasy Premier League and needed to know percentages and I've never known how to do them, it might as well have been rocket science to me, so I looked up how to do it online and now I can work out percentages with confidence and it's way easier and less daunting than I thought it would be.

I know it sounds like a silly thing to get excited about but it made me feel really good to learn something new, even it a was several years late!",0
"I've said this on another post I made a few hours ago, I moved a lot growing up. Across multiple states and different houses and apartments. I got to see a lot of cool things and meet interesting people. But it was killer on the friendships. It's hard to meet someone and establish yourself as being worthy of keeping in touch in such a short time. Naturally people ebb and flow in and out of your life. Always will. But it definitely affected the way I look at building meaningful connections and how I interact with those bonds. Everything was very temporary for a long time. Earlier I was in such a bad state. I'm going through a breakup. It was seven years and I met her when I was nineteen. I hadn't eaten in two days, and I think I might have been dehydrated from my medication. I just wasn't paying attention because I was so utterly empty, emotionally. Very tricky time. My mom found me passed out because I slept all day, probably from just not noticing how I was treating my body and it decided to have a little revolt. Anyway, My mom made me some food. And she just hugged me. And I felt comforted. Warmth. Really warm. It was remarkable that at twenty six years old, I felt as much as I did from that simple long hug. I ate my food and just sat with her, blearily waking up from my stupor. I was really groggy and had a hard time thinking properly. It was like sleeping the deepest of sleeps and waking up from it abruptly. We talked about how I was feeling and I just was content to be sad in her presense for awhile. It helped in a way. I told her later how grateful I was for her. She's a good mom. I go downstairs, I can't even remember why. I think I just wanted to move. And I get a phone call from a coworker, who helped me call off earlier that morning because I was feeling particularly not well today. And so I picked up. You guys. I'm very lucky to have the people in my life that I do. I have never had something like this before. The people I work with are the most charming, sincere, kind, and loving people. They came and got me, thirty minutes away, took me to a bar, fed me and got me drunk. And I couldn't stop laughing. I couldnt stop smiling. I am feeling fuzzy from my head to my toes. I just got dropped off at home. Things are going to get better. And it's moments like these, where as low as I am, people have a way of being able to lift you right on out of that no problem. Love your friends. Cherish them deeply. Same for your family. Sometimes they are all you need.",0
"Sometimes it is worth to left things that don't make you happy
Even when it's part of your whole environment
Take this as another way to get back to yourself
Sometimes it hurts and in most cases you have to expand someone's comfort zone
This is normal.
Now you choose how to live your own life
Time is a priceless currency of existence, and now it will begin to return to your treasury
At first, getting rid of the extra experience, you will feel uncertainty and emptiness
You are scared, because this is an escape from the most secure prison.
Are you ready to restore your freedom?
Fill yourself with what touches the depths of your soul, or leave this place for the realization of the most secret dreams
Just do not think to outwit life.
All the living deserve happiness and the right to choose
At some point you will discover a barely perceptible truth:
""My happiness depends only on me""
This world is a mirror of sensations.
What do you create by controlling this moment?

Sometimes it is worth believing that the only way out is to value ourselves, the universe and what we are right now",0
"I started college in August 2019 and had to take medical leave a few weeks before my first semester ended because I was experiencing severe psychosis and such. it's been such a rough battle since then but I've started taking control of my life like I never had before. I don't use eating as a coping skill, I don't self-harm anymore even when I have the urges, I've almost completely eliminated social media from my daily routine bc of how damaging it was for me and now, I'm able to bounce back from any issue with ease!!! it's such a freeing feeling and it makes me cry tears of happiness!
I'm beginning the process of returning to college and things are all moving so fast and I was worried that my boyfriend and I wouldn't have a place to stay there in town bc I'm going to live off campus until next semester. we applied for a 3 bedroom house rental with my parents as cosigners and I was so worried that we wouldn't get accepted bc of how strict house rentals are, we have a cat and neither my boyfriend or I had stable jobs right now but we really wanted to avoid apartments bc he makes music and needs the space
less than an hour ago, we got the email that we got approved for the house!!!! we've been so stressed about it but now that we know we have a place to go, things feel like they really are falling into place! it allows my ESA, it is less than 10 minutes from school, it's so spacious and an incredible place for our first rental! my boyfriend have essentially lived together for the past year and a half but this will be the first place we live where it's just us and we have it for at least a year, probably more since I'll be studying!!! away from both of our crazy families (that we love), back in a city that we fell in love with from the moment we first arrived, back to a school where I felt like I belonged.

"I wanted to post this somewhere, and i figured this subreddit was the best place.
I apologize for any weird formatting, I'm on my phone.

.

So, I have this best friend, ""J"", and he plays video games all the time. Several hundreds of Steam hours spent playing everything from fps games to strategy/survival games and the like. 

About a year and a half ago, he invited me to his discord server so I could hang out and meet his other friends. I would join to talk or play a few games with him an his friends, but for the most part J would stream whatever game he was currently playing for me to watch while i just hung out and talked to him.

Now, I enjoy watching him play, I really do. It's pretty entertaining most times. But sometimes he plays games that just aren't as interesting for me to watch. But have I ever told him that? No. 

Why?

Because I love hearing him talk. He gets excited about this game and will narrate his actions as he plays. He will start talking nonstop, either to me or just to himself, and gets more animated as the night goes on. Half of the time I understand it, but the other half I'm completely lost. It's very confusing and because of that I don't get as immersed. But the reason I keep asking him to stream his game for me, is because I love listening to him talk about it.

I don't think he knows how much I love to listen to him. If he's passionate about it, then I'm more than happy to listen to him talk for hours, and enjoy how happy he sounds.",0

"My cousin (C) got married this week. He has experienced more loss in his life than any one would deem fair. Our grandma to cancer, our grandpa to unknown causes, his other grandmother to Alzheimer's, his father to cancer, and, most heartbreakingly, his little sister (S) to suicide, when she was only 19.
During the ceremony, they were all mentioned, that they were here in spirit. I'd worn a necklace given to me by our grandma in Hawaii, because S had a matching one just like it from that same trip, and it felt like bringing the two of them along with me. During the wedding reception, though, there were two very poignant events that made me CERTAIN that they were there.
His other cousin, N, was dancing at the reception, completely carefree and goofy, full of joy and loving life. When I looked at her, I saw S in her. Completely on her own, my mom noticed this as well, and we agreed that S had come to join the party, because we knew that's exactly how she would be - dancing so hard as if nobody was watching, having the time of her life celebrating her brother's love.
And on my way back to our cabin (it was a mountain wedding), I saw a Chicken in a Biscuit cracker laying on the ground on the path going down to where the wedding was being held. My uncle, C and S's dad, LOVED those crackers, so much so that my mom would give him a box every year for Christmas as a joke gift.
They were there. And it made me really happy.",0

"I walked in to the store where I'm a regular at.
Most people where I live don't say much to the store clerks. They don't even say thank you.
I'm very friendly with this one store clerk I get over and over again. I just show him some basic courtesies and smile at him when I can and he always seems happy to see me.
The other day as I walked in, his checkout had no customers and I just walked over to tell him hes an amazing store clerk. He laughed and thanked me then I went off. He had a long smile throughout the time I was in the shop and seeing that made me happy too :)
I havent seen him since though. It has been more than 10 days. I hope he has taken leave (it is holiday period now) and is not avoiding me haha",0

"I don't usually like my birthday, it's historically been a very hard day for me. This year I actually had a nice time overall, and I can attribute it to my loving girlfriend, my family, and myself! My girlfriend made me feel so loved and special, she does that literally every day but today it meant the world to me. My abusive relationship prior to this one gave me many miserable birthdays. My family have also come so far in accepting me for who I am. I can finally feel their love again. I'm queer and it's been a struggle with them for many years, but I'm finally seeing progress.
And then there's me- I've fought through many battles to get to 26, and here I am! I take care of myself and love myself more than I ever have before, and I'm welcoming happiness back into my plife. Today was a good day. It was still difficult at some points, but it was far from miserable, and I'm really happy that I'm alive.",0

"So for a while now Iâ€™ve made it a mission whenever I visit a cafe to pay it forward.
Iâ€™m financially comfortable so am happy to share that where I can. 
If Iâ€™m out for coffee (maybe once a week), when paying my bill I pick another table or customer and anonymously pay their bill. I donâ€™t say anything I just pay and leave, and hope that person (or small group) smiles a little when they go to leave.
Today at a cafe (which wasnâ€™t the cheapest place I might add) I noticed a table of 4, with a caregiver and 3 intellectually challenged individuals having a meal. 
I asked the cashier quietly to pay their bill as I paid my own. 
As I walked to my car I was really happy and it was purely because of the feeling I had from that moment of doing something anonymously for someone else. 
Iâ€™m posting this not to boast, but to share a smile of my own - that hopefully was shared by that caregiver when she went to pay her bill.",0

"Sorry for any mistakes, english isnâ€™t my first language.

My (19F) life is going so great at this moment. 

End 2020 and beginning 2021 were hard on me. I stopped at the university I was going to, mostly because it was draining me emotionally and physically. The time I spend was work or study and it just was all too much for me. 

End 2020 I got in contact again with an old colleague (21M). And well, since new years eve weâ€™re officially together. We really had the honeymoon phase and we grew out of it, which was a pretty hard time. He went a little too far with a girl friend he hadnâ€™t seen in a while at a party. 

So it wasnâ€™t really a very hard time, but mostly emotionally draining and I was just tired of everything. 

But when I knew what kind of study I wanted to try next year, things suddenly got better. Iâ€™m going to study to become a math teacher. And in the country where Iâ€™m from, there is an enormous shortage of teachers. So I thought, why not send an open application to my old high school. You can always try! And I really wanted a different job, since my school is only one day in the week. 

Well, I got the job! I am a teacher next schoolyear! And I love it! So I am going to study for something I have passion for, and I will be working as the thing Iâ€™ve been dreaming about for years?!?? It is a life goal for me to achieve.

My boyfriend and I made up after having a rough time and even had many dates and weekends away to get closer to each other. He is really a great guy and he is trying so hard to help me trust him. He suprises me with flowers time to time, he takes me out on dates, listens to my problems and is ALWAYS understanding of things I donâ€™t feel great about. Our relationship is thriving!

But it is even getting better. My boyfriend and I wanted to move out of our parents houses, but we couldnâ€™t find anything and it was no priority. It isnâ€™t really common here to move out when you are 18. My dad has a small rental house in his backyard (the literal translation for it is a â€œsummerhouseâ€ or as we call it a â€œzomerhuisâ€). And the girl who lives there, is moving. So me and my boyfriend are going to move in end of this month!!!

We are renovating right now. And I just really wanted to share. My life really couldnâ€™t have been any better. Great school, my dream job, my dream man and a house!",0

"I’ve been struggling very badly with severe depression ever since I was very little… Ever since at least first grade I remember hating and hurting myself and crying all the time. 
I wasn’t diagnosed with depression and put on medication until I was thirteen though… I’m 21 now, 22 next month…
Anyway, ever since I was sixteen I’ve always wanted to learn Korean and I have been trying ever since then but I keep having really long depressive episodes that never really seem to end and I end up going several months without studying because I can bring myself to do anything… So I’m wondering how you can bring yourself to study even when your mental state won’t let you… 
Also I really have no social life and I can’t really do anything cause I don’t really have the means to… Also I ended up dropping out of college two years ago because of a pretty bad mental breakdown…
I’m completely worthless, and hopeless, and falling behind… I’ve never accomplished a single goal I’ve ever set and I most likely never will. I’m a complete waste of space, time, and money, and every day I wish that I had been aborted, died at birth, miscarried, or just had never existed in the slightest at all. I feel so trapped and I wish I could leave my body and never come back.
I daydream literally constantly (this is no exaggeration) ever since I was in kindergarten and I feel like I’d probably be dead if I couldn’t daydream because I can only escape myself through daydreaming and full-on sleeping. I often catch myself acting out and saying little things while Immediately daydreaming…
Also, I‘be gotten a psychiatrist recently… but whenever I get put on new medication(s) or the dosage is increased, it always seems to stop working after a while.. my psychiatrist was trying to get Spravato for me and I got approved at first, but then my insurance changed and it wasn’t covered anymore so now I feel even more hopeless than before. I don’t think I have any future and, if I do, nothing will ever turn out well…
I feel so miserable all the time that I wish I could scream… I feel so terrible. All I have are my daydreams… I don’t know… I wish I could fall asleep and live in my daydream forever and finally truly be happy. I just wanna be happy, or at least okay, and feel like there’s hope…
There are so many people meant for absolutely nothing and I worry that I’m one of those people.
I feel so empty… there’s nothing… I’ve always felt this way… I wish I could become someone else; someone who’s happy.
I feel like I’m grasping for something that never was and will never be. 
I don’t know…. This is a lot. I’m sorry for the long wall of text.. I’m nervous to post this… I’m so sorry to bother you. 
(Sorry if I made typos)",1
"I don't feel sustained happiness or joy, and I haven't in a very long time. I feel like I don't have the right to feel depressed, since I know it could be a lot worse. But I just feel this insatiable void inside me, and nothing I do or try can fill it or get rid of it. I only keep going to see if the promise ""It gets better"" is true or not. So far it hasn't, and there's nothing saying that it will. I have barely any friends, and social environments don't really exist in my life or routine. I know I want to make friends, be social, do things, go places, but that just doesn't happen easily for me. I've already graduated from highschool, don't plan on going to college, don't have a job at the moment (planning on it after I get my license). I simply just wake up to go back to bed in 16 hours. Sometimes I get random spurts of productivity, but it never lasts more than a few hours, and I always feel worse after then before. I try my best to introduce schedule in my life, but something else always happens that destroys it and if not, then it eventually falls apart on its own. I feel like all I can do is watch others be happy and do things with their lives, and I'm just stuck, and silent. Unable to make my presence known, unable to break the ice, unable to make an impact on literally anything. I hate when I do stuff like this, the thought of self-pity or complaining about my problems seems so gross and undeserved. I don't feel like I have the right to be heard when others are going through much worse than I am. I'll probably delete this later so I don't take up space. If you read any of this shit, thanks and sorry for your time.",1
"I am tired of playing this character. 

This handle I hold on to, this ideological representation of what I believe to be me is just that; an idea. 

If I let go of my ego completely and arrive at the person that does not serve this higher or entitled self image of himself, does this mean I cannot try to better myself because it assumes any attempt at growth to be a comparison to what I am not, thus creating a vicious circle.",1
"I am in college, and I just found out today that I have depression.

This all started when I lost my phone at the end of the day on my birthday. I never lose my phone and was kind of freaking out trying to find it, and I got some help to see if I just missed it. Once I found my phone, I felt like such a burden.

Fast forward through me just making little mistakes as I do and just thinking worse of myself than I usually do, leading last weekend being the first weekend that I have had some low-key suicidal thoughts (like I won't actually harm myself, but I do wonder what it would be like to just not exist).

I just feel like I can't do anything, and the only people I feel comfortable talking to about this are people I am in long-distance friendships with; I don't want to add to their stress, so I am just not gonna say anything. The only person at school I feel comfortable talking to has been acting strange, and I am unsure if he's upset or something....and I really don't want to find out because my parents are terrible at conflict, so I now think that conflicts just end everything, so I feel that if there's any conflict, it's over....so that is making me feel uncomfortable to talk about what I am going through with this particular friend. 

So basically, I am not smart, which leads me to feel like a burden to other people, which leads me to not think well of myself, which makes me believe I am a burden to people all the while feeling burnt out, exhausted, and hopeless, and I don't know what to do",1
I’m realizing I don’t feel comfortable anywhere right now. I feel uncomfortable and out of my skin everything around me. I feel like it’s just me and it is. My mom is gone and my last support system doesn’t provide support anymore. I’m suicidal but I would be fine if I died right now. It wouldn’t scare me.,1
"I’m a 16 year old girl who’s has been very confident and radiant for the past few months however it all went very downhill when something just turned on in my brain. First I was very anxious because I noticed that my face is asymmetrical and just unusual and all of my confidence just disappeared. I kept complaining and crying to my mum but and she tried her best to comfort me but I just couldn’t stop worrying and now she can’t sleep because of me stressing her out. I feel very irritated with myself because I know the solutions to my problems but I just lost all motivation and the only emotion I feel is stress. The thing is I’m not even suicidal I just don’t know what to do with myself. I haven’t slept for 2 days and my skin is literally lifeless, I can’t feel physical pain when I pulled my hair out by accident I couldn’t even feel it. Please can someone help me.",1
Pretending is something I've always been pretty good at.. always putting up a front for everyone because that's what society wants. But I feel so bad.. I lie to my girlfriend all the time about what's going on in my head and how I feel. I couldn't ever tell her that I've felt like killing myself a few times or let her know truly how much I despise myself.. but she's the only good thing that I have in my life and I don't want to ruin what we have by making it into some giant depression therapy case. She's got a lot going on too and I just feel like she doesn't need the extra weight on her shoulders.,1
"Life is very difficult right now because all of my friends and family want to talk to me like normal but I always push them away without an explanation... but dealing with this disease I'm sure y'all know it's not that easy to just tell everybody that you wish you were dead, because that's how you will further be defined. I just want everyone to know without me telling them, to offer them some explanation for my behavior, but it's never that simple.",1
"Oh god oh god oh god oh godI can’t take another failure. I just can’t. I don’t even know what I want to do. Oh god why am I such a failure. Why is everything so fucking loud.

I wish I could be murdered. No one would blame me. It’s not my fault. Why can’t they see how hard it is to not off myself? I wake up every miserable day, losing and failing time and time and time and time again. I wake up for THEM. Why is my mind so fucking dark. I didn’t mean it. Please please please God please plea",1
"Early 20s. Kind of seems better than dying at like 80 or smth. If im just working to try to make ends meet, if im just studying for a stupid fucking letter, damn, if i just wanted fucking stupid. All i do is stress and work myself sick. What's the fucking point of living if im just in pain. Fucking study my life away. Work my life away at a shitty job that can barely make money. I'm too stupid to go to grad school. I'm barely keeping up in undergrad. I killed my social life because all i do is suffer in vain in the work that will just result in failure. What's the point of 60 more years of pain if I can just die now and not have to give a shit about my lack of a future.",1
"I was diagnosed as depressed when I was 20 and now I'm 34. Most of that time it hasn't been as bad as this.
I don't have the energy to do anything. I'm a mom with two kids (kindergarten &amp; 2nd grade). I get them to school in the morning, come back to the house, and sleep until it's time to pick them up. After school I make sure nobody injures anyone else while reading on my phone, trying not to sleep again, and we have leftovers or cereal or ramen for dinner unless my amazing husband has another idea. Then we all go to bed and I sleep all night and wake up tired in the morning.
I love making things, sewing or knitting for people, I have half a mural painted on one wall of my house. Haven't been able to do any of that lately. Can't make myself cook, and I love cooking.
My last living grandparent, he's over 90, he was doing great until just recently, but then he started going downhill a week ago and he's probably not going to live another week. I'm autistic as well, and it's hard to figure out which problems are from depression and can hypothetically be resolved with medicine, and which are just permanently part of me from the autism. Fun fact, BIG emotions (like last time some one I knew died) cause me to not cry, just shut down and sleep more
My 8-y.o. has been having trouble at school, she's very bright and academically ahead but she is autistic too and she's been acting out. She has zero impulse control and will do things specifically because someone told her not to. Today she got suspended for a day and a half for mooning the office staff. I'm so embarrassed and frustrated. Oh and my medicine.
I have been on sertraline since my 5-y.o. was born. Also a thyroid medicine and now abilify. My doctor added the abilify and increased my sertraline from 100 to 150 mg about a year ago.
They usually make me feel somewhat better but I ran out of refills and couldn't care hard enough to get more, which I AM AWARE is making my problems worse, but being off them for a couple weeks accidentally has exposed some side effects that were so gradual I didn't notice them (and don't know which of my medicines they're from) but now that they're gone I don't want them back.
I want to talk to my doctor but he doesn't have any open appointments until JANUARY. I could probably get more refills without an appointment, just a phone call, but I really want to talk to him about other options...
I'm so tired of not being able to deal with crud",1
this isn’t a cry for help or anything. just a passing thought. but i think that depression will be the reason i die. i will never get better. it’s a cycle that never ever ends. i’m young now but one day i won’t be. one day i’m gonna be too tired to do this anymore.,1
That’s it. If I somehow turned normal looking tomorrow I wouldn’t even care about my any other problems. Nothing beats being repulsive to both yourself and others,1

The thing that’s driving me the most insane is I can see the things that I’m doing that are destroying my life and my relationships and my finances yet I keep doing them. Like I’m not even clouded when I do them. I think it’s a bad idea and then I just do it anyway knowing full well it’s damaging my life. My car is going to shit, my bank account is going to shit, my body is going to shit, my relationship is flat. I can’t stop and I don’t know why. I’ve been depressed as long as I can remember.

"My first suicide attempt was at age 9, and the first time I ever got hospitalized was at age 14. That year, I attempted suicide TWICE, and each time, I was found and taken to the hospital. I wasn’t suppose to live past that age. I wish nobody ever found me. Sure I’m alive because of it, but now I have to live with nerve damage and scars that will only get worse with age and serve as a reminder of what I’ve done and how pathetic I am. It’s funny, when I was younger, I didn’t expect myself to live past 14. And now here I am, still alive even after multiple suicide attempts that would’ve been successful save for the intervention of other people. I’m caught between drinking myself to death and genuinely turning my life around. I don’t think I have the strength to do the latter. I’ve been through abuse my entire life, became an alcoholic at 12, got hooked on opioids at 14, and I’m a drop out. Realistically, the chances of me having a successful life and being a decent person are slim to none. Hell, I don’t even have any friends. I feel so hopeless and like such a loser. The only reason why I haven’t shot myself in the head yet is because, knowing me, I’d just miss and end up mentally incapacitated. I want to be happy and get better, but I just don’t have the energy or resources to. I know I need therapy and probably medication, but my parents aren’t able to afford it. Not sure why I’m posting this. I just feel weak and alone. I hope that, one day, I can’t turn my life around and stop slowly killing my self.",1
"8 years ago I have been diagnosed with Tourette syndrome and my has been a complete void from it.

Slowly after I have been showing OCD 8 years ago, have seen all my friends leaving me
Some became distant because it became a shame to be seen with me,some started ignoring me and some joined the numerous people that started bullying me for my difference.
My whole middle school and highschool has been a pure hell,people laughed at me,pushed me everywhe even in stairs,some people were even spitting on me regularly.

I have been left a complete husk,I am unable to trust anyone,I have been hating my self for years.
I never had any new friends after this and I feel completly exhausted,I am so tired of seing everyone around me be so happy and knowing I will never be like them.

I can't even go outside without being glared at by strangers or hearing people making comments about me today while I was grocery shopping I saw a kid pointing at me and asking his mother why I was acting weird ,I have been left devastaded as I heard her scolding her kif because pointing at insane people could be dangerous.

I am not gonna lie,I have been thinking about suicide a lot,I have been feeling completly empty and worthless for several years and I can't take much more.
I have tried therapy but all they ever gave me was hollow advices like ""you should go outside and try to socialize"" or worse ""this will get better""

"I have recently been hospitalized for almost killing myself this past week. The psych hospital was hell, I hated every second of it and found a way to cut while in there and using my nails to scratch my skin till i saw blood. I eventually realized I would need to fabricate progress to ever see the light of day again so I lied to the doctors and I lied to myself.

Leading up to me getting admitted I had been just been prescribed prozac for a month but had not been taking it. Instead I wanted to drink and do drugs and started cutting. Eventually I spiraled too far and couldn’t get out of bed and couldn’t go to school. My dad found my cuts and I got drunk for therapy and told her that I was about to kill myself on halloween and I almost attempted but instead fell asleep. She told my mom and I ended up in the er. 

Today is my second day home and I have not been on my meds for two days (they put me on Latuda) because we are having trouble with the pharmacy. Now that voice in my head is telling me to just not take the pills in the first place and to cut instead and do more drugs. I feel like they will make me normal and i want to be something more and want to feel something more than normal. I also hate myself so its hard to take them.

Idk if anyone understands but i feel like im going down that same spiral and idk what to do.",1
"I've had bad depression for a long time now, kicked up after an ex used me. I cant tell anyone because I'm in the system and I'll be stripped of my belongings and shipped off to a mental facility for a month and a half. The only thing that helped me deal with it is my current ex who picked up my peices afterwards. But I got so bad that I started becoming more unresponsive and suicidal again and it ruined our 2 year relationship. I made her feel like she couldn't make me happy and that she wasnt doing anything right because of it. And I hate myself for it. She left me, and I got even worse, I've been having multiple attempts the last few days and one of them I shouldnt have survived. That really hurt her more. I suggested that we distance ourselves from eachother for a while so we can work out our mental problems as she has it bad too. She agreed and it kills me more to do it, but I really dont want to hurt her more. But now my mental is like on lockdown. I'm almost completely numb, and inactive besides the bare minimum to make me seem like a normal person, I cant stop thinking of how much I miss her and how it was my fault.

"Teenage me had the kind of depression where you could look things up online and identify with what was being said. It allowed me to understand what was happening and told me I wasn't alone.

I went through therapy and dealt with the issues I used to identify with. Sure, I'm now a happier person because of it but on nights like tonight where it comes back for no reason, I can't find anything that I can relate to. No blog posts, no articles, not even music can help me now. And because I don't know what's causing it, I can't describe it to anyone.

I know I'm not alone in my depression, but not being able to see anyone going through the same thought processes as me anymore is fucking torture.",1
"Hey guys, I have found myself stuck in this situation that I can’t seem to get myself out of.

For context: I’m a 16yo F, going to an accelerated school; I could be graduating in March or April of 2022.

My depression is heavily triggered by school. I find little motivation to do any work, and getting out of bed is extremely difficult.

When I was in 8th grade until I was a sophomore, I missed out on a lot of school because I was mentally unwell. The school I am attending now though requires attendance since it has only about 30 students. Going to school is difficult, and staying through the school day is even harder.

Recently, I have been unable to take mental health days from school, and I believe it’s because my parents think I’m using my illness as an excuse, and I just dont want to go to school. My mom has no history of mental illness on her side, while my dad struggles from depression himself. 

The problem is I have lost all motivation to do my schoolwork. I’m falling behind in my classes, and it’s stressing out my parents. I suggested getting my ged instead, but my mom is frustrated by the idea that I would rather take a test than just finish up highschool. 

My mom doesn’t support me getting my GED, but she’s not stopping me from getting it either. She refuses to unenroll me from highschool though (you can’t be enrolled in highschool in order to take the test here). 

I just feel like im causing a lot of stress and frustration to my parents, and I’ve completely lost motivation to do anything with school. 

Any suggestions?",1

"TW: mentions of suicide I (20F) have been in the worst mental health of my entire life recently and I'm not sure what to do at this point. For context, I go to a pretty academically rigorous university and spend majority of my time (*trying* *to at least*) doing homework and going to class. I also am lucky to have an extremely loving boyfriend who understands my mental health struggles and is nothing but supportive. My whole life I've felt like people don't like me. It's been sort of an anxiety trigger for me, I always think that people (especially people I care about like my friends) are talking behind my back, texting about me, or are annoyed at me or something that I did. I don't necessarily know why I fixate on this so much but it really really affects me and my relationships. I think a lot of the time I'm right tho, people are annoyed at me, because I'm an annoying person. I don't know, I just really really don't like myself and I guess I'm not surprised that other people wouldn't like me either - or at least that I feel like others don't. I guess I deserve it.
The worst worst worst part of all of this is that I'm completely unable to focus on schoolwork, conversations, and daily life. My head feels so clouded and foggy I don't even know how to describe it but even just sitting down and typing this reddit post out is so taxing on my mind. I never used to be like this. I think school and depression are just eating me away. Besides my significant other I don't really see a reason to keep living. My life is like a repeated cycle of anxiety and depression. I'm sorry if this comes off as attention seeking or dramatic but I don't really know where else to turn to at this point. I don't consider myself actively suicidal (I don't have a plan or anything like that) but it's scary that its become something that I'm even thinking about if that makes sense. I was on 20mg (a starter dose) of Prozac for the past month or so, felt like absolute shit, dissociating daily and literally wanting to stop existing entirely. *Finally* got to see my psychiatrist again today and she changed me to 150mg of Wellbutrin and then I'm going up to 300mg in 2 weeks. I've tried Wellbutrin before and it didn't really work entirely for me but I was also only on 75mg before so hopefully this new dosage will provide me with some energy and focus and hopefully some happiness because I'm so sick of feeling this way. I don't think I've gone a single day without crying in over a month. I'm tired of it and I want something to change. I also just feel bad for my significant other because he is really getting the worst of me, and although he says he just wants to help me and I know he isn't mad at me for it, I feel so bad because he deserves someone happy and motivated and all around better than me, idk. If you actually took all the time to read this super long depressing boring post then thank you, literally any words of advice or just support is greatly greatly appreciated &lt;33",1
"I am at the end of my rope. And I have a crumb of wax left. I'm gonna lose it. In 2020 I went to rehab twice. I was there for benzos and opiates. But I was doing every drug you'd put in front of me.... and I had every drug in front of me. There was just very VERY easy access. Long story. But as soon as I got out of rehab the last time and out of the halfway house, I went straight to weed. It was the one thing I knew I could do. I just had it in my head. I just find so much comfort in it. Soo much. Depression has taken my ability to enjoy anything. I feel terrible. It has taken almost entirely my ability to feel hungry. I went from 150 pounds to 122. But when I smoke I feel happy. I feel warm. I smile. I feel hungry. Games are fun again. It just allows me to enjoy my other typical escapist techniques. However I acknowledge that I can not keep this up. I dont even work. Like wtf am I doing??? I smoked half an ounce of wax in the past three weeks. I genuinely just wanna start taking xans again. I'd do it as if it were a prescription to keep my tolerance low. Idk anymore. I've distanced myself very far from my family. And even far from myself. I'm basically not a person.

"A few years ago I ended up admitted to the hospital because I got so depressed I didn’t eat for over a week. I considered that my rock bottom. A few months ago I moved to a different town, got a new job, and moved out of my parents house for the first time to live with my partner. I thought all this would make me happy finally. Actually all I did was manage to put distance between my mom (who I really am pretty close to), my dog, and the friends I have. I have no friends here at all and I’m so lonely I also don’t like my job here

I do love my partner but he can be pretty draining to be around. He’s very critical and a perfectionist though he himself has so many flaws. I definitely see them but look past them and accept them because I know he is human. I don’t get the same feeling from him. The worst part is though I’m spiraling into a deeper depression every month he has no idea but even worse he’s the type of person who would just tell you to take a walk, or a deep breath or some shit if I told him I was feeling depressed. He has 0 understanding, he doesn’t see me for who I am as a person I think, just who I am on the surface when I’m in a good mood. I’m supposed to be studying to get into a nursing program but sometimes after work I just want to lay down and do nothing. I feel awful. He sees this and starts badgering me asking me if I’ve studied when’s the last time I did blah blah. At this point I’d rather just lie or keep things from him to shut him the fuck up

"I (F22) wasn’t always like this. I used to be motivated and have goals. I was valedictorian in my high school and I have been a straight A student in college for three of the previous four years. I had an amazing internship that would have made finding a well paying awesome job so easy. All my professors loved me. I was surrounded with some really good friends. I was eating healthy and excersizing. I was so proud of myself. Then all of a sudden, everything changed in my senior year. 2020. 

I went from having straight As to failing every single class. I’m in my fifth year because I’m having to retake all my classes, and I’m even failing one of those now. I’ve lost some of my closest friends because I shut myself in and didn’t reach out for a few months. They went from being my best friends to not even wanting to speak to me when I reached out. That amazing internship? I lost it because I pretty much abandoned them. That will probably always be one of my biggest regrets in life. Why? I have no idea but the thought of going there made me so anxious I couldn’t sleep. For over a year I haven’t been able to sleep well. Even if I haven’t slept in two days, the second I try to fall asleep my brain gets all nervous and wakes me back up. I can only go to sleep if I accidentally fall asleep watching a video or doing a puzzle, or if I’m with my boyfriend. 

I stopped leaving my house. There was a time last year the only times I left my apartment were to pay rent and maybe get groceries once or twice a month. I either barely ate anything or ate a whole pizza as both a reward and a punishment. I went from accidentally losing 20 pounds to gaining 30 within about four months. 

I am doing slightly better this semester but only slightly. I’m fighting so hard but I’m only really doing well in one class. I used to get straight As no issue but now I’m just trying not to fail. And failing at that. 

This whole last year I thought this was all happening because I just turned into a lazy piece of shit overnight. I am having to think about writing a resume and applying to jobs now and it’s making me feel like shit, because I don’t feel deserving of any job. I don’t even have anyone I can put as a reference or ask for a recommendation. 

Today I had the random thought maybe this is something deeper and read up on depression. I hit nearly every box of warning signs everywhere I looked. Idk why it took me so long considering mood disorders run in the family. This past year has ruined everything I spent the last decade working towards. However, I take some comfort knowing that some of it may be some messed up wiring in my brain rather than me being a complete useless waste of space human. 

TLDR: Turns out, depresssion may have contributed to the hellish last year I’ve had.",1
"have been sad for long as i can remember. i didnt grow up with a mother, she kinda abandoned me, my dad used to abuse me physically and mentally. he wouldnt let me eat, he would kiss me with that smelly cigarrete mouth, he would put his fingers down there, he made me kiss his girlfriends, watch him bathe. i would often see he coming home drunk and also abuse my grandparents, aunt and uncle. i sometimes thought he would kill them. i would spent hours locked in the bathroom, afraid. my grandparents from my mom's side also hate me, i think they wish i was aborted and i havent ever seen then. nowadays the abuse continues, my dad often tells me things like ""kill yourself"" ""shoot yourself in the head"" ""cut your fucking wrists"", he had threatened to break my bones and once kicked me from home because i cut my hair short (the house isnt even his, its my grandparents house, my dad doesnt work). my grandparents are now older, i have to take care of almost everything. i have to always be there because im afraid of my dad beating them. my grandparents also give all their money to my dad so he can drink and buy his drugs because theyre too afraid of him. i have no friends and a big part of the teens of my city hates me because of an abusive ex boyfriend i had. no one ever wanted to know my side of the story. i have been so sad for so long that i feel like i dont have enough energy to even hurt myself or kill myself anymore. im bad at school, my grades suck and i have no hobby. i literally have no reason to be alive but i cant even finish all of this. i dont have a religion, i cant find anyone or anything to love. dont have enough energy to listen to new music or watch new movies. im the ugliest person i have ever seen. hate my body, my face, my sh scars, my personality. and all of this sound so dumb, like it isnt anything at all, like its not bad at all. even my psychologist have been abusing me mentally. my grandparents dont let me leave my home, not even at the door to breath some fresh air. they are too afraid of the world, but is not like i dont know what happens out there. everything in this text is probably messed up and grammatically wrong and no one will read this bullshit. even not loving anyone i want to say: i love you. who is ""you""? i dont know, i just wish i could say this. im only 16, why does it have to be like this? i have no future. lol.",1

"Im 23 and I talked to this girl online for a few days,she is from my city,we talked for about 6 days and today we met for the first time,I really thought I liked her and was interested in her,she wanted a real and enduring relationship just like i do,and today it felt fine,we kissed and cuddled, til a point where she obligated me, pretty much ordered me to delete all pics with my ex gf,a girl I was with for almost 2 years,I deleted about 2 or 3 pics but my heart melted a bit doing it,I couldnt find a way to delete all plus there were many on Facebook and all and she was lik""fine,you gotta delete them all when you get home though"".
When I got home she started acting angry and bossy and almost threw a tantrum I still had pics with my ex,and she again ordered me to delete them when I tried doing it i started crying,as even though we had bad moments,I had great ones too and it was a good part of my life that lasted for quite a while and I was supposed to delete and forget all of that over a girl I spend only 2 hours with?
 Besides this,a day before this date of mine got angry at me that I fell asleep as I was talking to her as I had been on the phone texting her for those 6 days almost non stop and barely had sleep and she got angry at that too.
For the simple fact my body couldnt keep me awake anymore,I decided I dont want this,and she almost made me miss my ex with this attitude as she would have done something like this if it hurt me,did I do something wrong not wanting to talk to this girl again?",1
"I just had to do a test. The tine limit was 3 hours but that still stressed me out. I sat there trying to write down anything but I was having SUCH A HARD TIME. I couldn't think. No coherent sentences were forming on the page. Or in my brain. Nothing was reachable in there. Every time I thought abuot how I couldn't think, tears would start to form. Then all I could think about was how stupid I am for this. So I gave up. I emailed my professor about maybe doing it another time. I literally cannot CANNOT do it right now. I hope she understands.

I'm currently crying and wondering if it's all going to work out. Please tell me it will work out. Please tell me someone's gone through this and can tell me that it will work out.

Please.",1
"So I have bipolar disorder and ADD and it’s really messed up my life. I’m on my second week without leaving the apartment and I’m once again finding myself dropping deeper into depression, but there’s one thought that’s been coming back to me over and over again. At this point, I don’t care about my own life. I’ve burned most of my bridges, tried tons of treatment and meds with no success and frankly, I’m done trying to find happiness. However, I was wondering if any of you know a way I could dedicate myself to a greater cause? Like maybe an organization that helps people or animals and will give me food and shelter in exchange for my help? I feel like if I’m physically unable to be happy living for myself, might as well be unhappy helping others instead, you know?",1
"I sleep alot or not enough at times. I struggle with insomnia and day/night reversal. I usually wake up really late at night. May parents take issue with it obviously. I try to stay out of their way. I think my mom thought I wasn't up and I heard her talking shit about me to her friend. About how the person I was is gone. How I'm not like other girls my age and I don't buy clothes and take care of myself. How all her hopes for me shattered in the last two years or so. She's right on all fronts. I don't buy clothes, I don't take care of myself, and that I've lost it. What hurt me was how she was so rude about it and about how she knew I'm struggling yet decided to make fun of me to her friends. She made a comment about something I shared with her in private about my period being extremely irregular. She said to her friend ""It's because she's crazy and think a lot of course her body doesn't work."" She then went on to say that when I enter the mental hospital and they pump me full of meds and when I'm sleeping in a bed unable to function and wipe my own saliva she won't come to visit me. I cried for a few minutes because it hurt so much. I'm diagnosed with OCD and depression. I can't function in life and probably won't ever again. I'm afraid of driving so I won't get a license. I can't will myself to be better I'll probably rot somewhere and won't even care. My hands are shaking as I write this. I just don't understand why she's so cruel to me what is it about me that says ""kick me while I'm down."" After I cried and journaled for a bit she came to my room and started agitating me and I just lost it. I'm not a violent person but something in me just broke. I broke stuff and told her to fuck off and that I heard all that she said. She didn't care and went on to say ""It's not my fault you've lost it."" I asked her why she didn't come to me if she knew I was struggling. Whys he had to humiliate me in front of her friends. She ignored it and said ""You left once. You should leave my house. I'll call the cops on you."" By then I was hysterically crying. Back in 2019 I told her about how I was having really bad thoughts and was suicidal. I shit you not she laughed in my face and told me to close the door as she was leaving to a wedding. This reminded me of that. I'm still suicidal it's something I've always struggled with. I went to the kitchen and grabbed a knife I think I was gonna hurt myself. My sister came and took the knife. And here I am just writing what happened. I want to move out and never see her again. I also want to sleep and never wake up again.",1
"This is incredibly long, for which I am sorry. I need to vent.

It hurts when you realize that people who are supposed to be your support and source of comfort, well, are not like that. You wish for a family, a place where you feel like a part of something, but it crushes you instead, like a huge 5-storey ugly steel truck. And you realize that and you hate them, and you hate yourself, and you hate everybody. I guess that's how bitter adults are made... Never thought I would become one of them. Since childhood I was supervised 24/7, told what to do. I did not get to choose what I am about to wear, or to eat, or what I wanted to do. When my parents did not have the time to decide for me, I would feel lost, isolated, I wouldn't feel loved. This made me feel like the life's manual was never given to me, nor was I advised in any particular way. I would never know is it my opinion or someone else's. I would absorb it and I would believe it. I would cling onto it for dear life as I wanted to feel something. 

I ended up being a pretty gifted kid, mastering several languages, going to contests in sciences, valedictorian and all that, but looking back at all this I wanna cry and hug that student. I DID NOT LIKE ANY OF IT. I did not feel gratified at the end. I could not find myself. I tried so many things. But each try would result in more bitterness and despair. My biggest fantasy would be to be someone else. Someone, whose mind is set on something, who can master something and own up to it. To be obsessed, to be immersed in your trade, is my biggest dream.

Instead, everything is just meh. Once in a while, I would take an erratic move, to prove myself I am still there, under all of this fluff of pretend ""accomplishments"" and ""having it all together"". One example is, I got into a med school straight out of high school, but dropped out before the classes started, because my parents are doctors and I felt I have been pressured into it. Instead, I got admitted into university literally on the other side of the planet. And as a 17-year-old, I escaped. What I had then where 4 years of discovery and growth I will always cherish. But these 4 years were also devastating, as I did not enjoy my program very much, did not know what to do, felt lost and incompetent 70% of the time. But hey, isn't everyone's early 20s like that? One of the biggest disappointments happened when my family did not like my boyfriend, whom I love deeply and am still with (3 happy years together as I am writing this). I thought I was close with my family, but the way my dad tried to manipulate me into breaking up with my boyfriend (hey, it actually worked on 18-year old me, and I dumped my bf, an action I will always regret; eventually, I initiated getting back together after starting drinking and smoking and becoming extremely depressed), convinced me I cannot trust anyone but myself. Until today, my dad is gaslighting me, pretending my boyfriend does not exist (literally, based on my conversations with my father one can suppose I have made my boyfriend up), disregarding my feelings completely. My mom, well, she's a character. When I tell her about what moves me or what I care about, she either 1) criticizes it, 2) pretends she does not hear it, 3) develops some sort of heartache or head ache to attract my attention and to say ""See, this is what you are doing to me!"". I can't even explain how much of my teen years I have lived feeling guilty for all those fucking headaches! And for what! For staying out with friends until 9 pm instead of 8 pm, for telling her I don't like a piece of clothing she gifted me, because she knows I don't like it and still gifts it to me. I know both my parents love me, but they hurt me even more, therefore I have no other way to behave other than exclude them from my life. Not completely, but as much as possible.

As an aside, here are some things my parents have been (and still are on a regular basis) burning into my brain:

1. I HAVE to be a doctor. There's no other way I can exist in this world

2. I should NEVER make any mistakes

3. If I don't end my relationship they will make me come back to my home country

4. If I don't do as they tell me, I will end up poor and miserable

Again, I did more that I was asked to. Again, not feeling fulfilled. My bitterness would grow like a houseplant. I decided to decline an offer to go to Master's program, since I wanted to work a little bit first. I got a job offer in Vancouver. Here we go. 22 year old, living by herself in a big city, working full time. Day in and day out. Day in and day out. I do not feel fulfilled, job is boring and no one really cares if I show up. I stick to it as a means to survive, but otherwise I do not like it. I felt blue for a while, and after seeing a doctor, I was told I have depression. I tried medication and therapy. Therapy worked but I ditched medication as it did not work for me. Here I am now, typing this, realizing how unhappy I am that I am forced to choose between my boyfriend and my family. And I am choosing him, because he SEES me. He loves me and cares for me. With him, I feel understood. Why on earth can't my mom and dad be at least 10% like him? Oh and by the way, they don't like him because he is Persian. Without meeting him once, they keep telling me all the terrible things he will do to me as someone from a Middle-Eastern country. Honestly, it would be funny if it was not so painful. 

How I am feeling now? I feel like I am in a free fall, accelerating with every second. I feel like I am going to hell, but I don't care. I live in hell. My mind makes me so unhappy, and I cannot imagine a happy life for myself. But I also have a feeling this is out of my control, this has to happen to me. I am doing wrong to my family, I am neglecting my life. I am barely holding this together.",1
"I also have this posted on r/awakened btw

I looked in the mirror a moment ago and it scared me. For so long i have been stuck in my own head, thinking i was just a ghost drifting through society, emotionally, spiritually, and somewhat physically. It scared me because i realized the person i saw in the mirror was real. I am that person. People see me and talk to me and i interact with them. Over the past years, i have been using disassociatives to get high, and i got sober 9 months ago. I am constantly realizing how much of an impact that has had on diminishing whatever self image i had of myself, and made me dislike social interaction in general. But ive realized that i need more help than self reflection and a therapist. This is where i need help. 

I need people to talk to to expand myself, help me build my self image, my character and my morals, and even my interests. I hope by connecting with others, i can form strong relationships that give me a sense or purpose and a will to keep going. If anyone would like to chat, even for a short amount of time, that would be more than helpful.

Btw, i have been doing much better than before. I recently graduated high school, and i have a job. Im saving up for a car and to go to college. Im still very depressed and sometimes even psychotic, but being sober has given me the ability to reflect on myself seriously instead of just putting myself down and the universe i exist in, which i am forever greatful for. In drug rehab, and throughout my therapy, i have been taught to reach out to others, which i haven't taken seriously until now. This is my desperate cry for help.",1

During the day I can laugh and be ""happy"" but as soon as night time rolls around I'm kinda stuck laying in bed trying to get away from my schziphrenia and a major wave of depression just strikes me, and before you say it's just sadness.

"Hiya! Not really sure how to start this but idk, I need help and I'm looking everywhere to find it. I can't sleep anymore and that is contributing largely to how bad my anxiety and depression are getting. But I go to bed at night and I'm terrified of death, so I stay up all night until I can't keep my eyes open, and then I'll sleep all day the next day if nothing wakes me up. I've been trying to do good, but I do shady things sometimes too out of despiration usually. I work a shit job, I've desperately been trying to find a new one to no avail, I've been offered different jobs but they're all usually base min wage jobs that I know I'm gonna be treated like shit in, and at least the one I'm in now I have some control. I'm seeing a therapist and have a psych eval in December, but it's getting really hard for me to exist. I'm not as close with the beings I love as much as I'd like to be because I'm just barely holding myself together, so. Much so that I'm not really me anymore, my meds have kept changing and I'm sure that's a part of it too, but when my grandpa died last year, who I was really close to, my entire life changed and I feel like I'm desperately clawing at every day tasks just to exist and it's getting so hard.. I won't die because I'm terrified of not existing but I'm in this horrible cycle of feeling like the world is shit and I'm just not going to exist one day, I have all of this conflicting feelings my brain is just tearing itself apart... Idk man life sucks ig but I'm struggling and don't know what to do anymore

"I'm 25, I have a job that I don't hate (unlike the last one) and I'm studying something I want (how to make videogames), I live with my sister my mom her boyfriend (he's fine) and for the time being my grandfather is also living with us. I don't have debts (only one but is manageable), and I'm financially stable. But I feel so lonely that everything feels so pointless, there's always people in my home but I rarely talk to them about personal stuff because when I try they generally ignore me or they give me a generic response (it's not that they are bad they're just busy), I have only one friend but he's very busy as well and we don't even live nearby anymore, so if I get excited I realize I cannot share the excitement with anyone and the excitement turns into sadness, if I do something that I'm proud nobody will care so it doesn't matter, if I wanna talk about something I just don't do it, even doing stuff like playing games feels pointless. Besides I realized that somebody will always fill my place way better than me so since I'm really replaceable nobody will ever care, just to be clear I'm not planning to suicide but life feels so pointless that I don't really see much point on living either.

"We broke up almost 3 years ago now and i cant forget her. I keep thinking ive finally gotten over her then i see a picture of us and it triggers so many bad memories. I still have a box full of her stuff. Ive dated other woman and ive broken up with those woman and still im focused on this single girl from high school. I hurt her so bad and the breakup was nasty, i traumatized her and i wish i could make things better. She was a good friend and i loved her. I still love her i think. But i know that theres no redemption here, i have to live with the fact she doesnt want anything to do with me. I know one day ill meet someone i love who loves me and what worries me is that i might not be over this girl by then. No one can compare to her. She was the perfect romance and she made me feel cared about. I dont think id be able to have a adult relationship bc they arent like that, they are so much more... Empty. Less flirting with each other over late night calls and more so just dating and talking to each other a couple times a day, at least thats my experience.",1

"I’ve been struggling to overcome my addiction, I’m 19 and have been struggling with it for over half a decade, My family is aware of the problem, have been for years. At first my mom and and uncle tried to help me but after awhile they stopped. I don’t blame them since I wasn’t very forthcoming about my struggle and downplayed it a lot. In case you’re wondering, my addiction isn’t drugs but pornography, you can see why it’s hard for me to open up about it to someone, especially family. I never thought I’d struggle with something like this. Most of them know, they don’t ask about it anymore, I don’t blame them. I’ve struggled with my faith for years, I’ve asked God for help, pleaded and I really did tried to seek him out with my whole heart, denying myself and prioritizing him. Yet I’m still in the same place, nobody gives a shit anymore, my step dad who I thought the world of doesn’t really care about me anymore. Again I don’t blame them since I wasn’t really welcoming to anyone once my addiction started getting bigger. My relationships with my siblings is strained, I’ve tried opening up to my younger brother but he doesn’t really care. I’m just so tired of fighting this battle everyday for years now. There’s so much more going on but I’m afraid no one will understand, deep inside me my faith is still there and I know God is real, if I knew he wasn’t I would’ve killed myself years ago, there’s so much I can’t put into words.

So I twist my arm quickly away and got really serious, unintentionally of course mainly out of instinct. The rest of the night went by and I went home. Tonight when I got to work another employee told me that my friend called them crying. I guess I scared her. Why am I such a fuck up all the time? Why couldn't I just let her write on my god damn arm? What the hell is wrong with me?",1

I tried to stick to my schooling though. It was tough for the first month bit I got through it. The second month I could feel myself falling off and tried to go to the councilors that the school offers but was put on a waiting list. I proceeded to fall off even more and miss almost a straight month of classes. I kinda pulled myself together at the beginning of August but quickly fell off again. Now, im just completely burned out and depressed. I barely have enough energy and motivation to get out of bed, let alone go to class and do homework, projects and tests. I've been on the counciling waiting list for 2 months. I need help but I don't know where to go, who to talk to or what to do.

"Depression oftentimes gives you a surge of creativity unmatched by anything you've ever experienced. Your poems become deep, your songs become more meaningful, and the stories you write become more impactful. It's beautiful that way but it comes with a price. Depression builds what it can destroy. It builds your confidence, only to destroy it right before your eyes. Months later you'll be too empty and miserable to be creative that you won't be able to do anything, not even eat or get out of bed.

Depression creates a blanket only to pull it back to abandon you in the cold.",1

Now I have to finish my thesis but I'm simply unable to write. I will probably delay for the next year and cancel my graduation party (and lose money, yikes)
That said, I'm also depressed since high school, with an extreme low self-esteem, which has worsened in the last months (maybe because of the stress). I went to therapy but it never worked for me. Talking to my mother, she said this might be caused by my dislike of the subject. I really don't love my graduation (law), but also never liked any other options (I have even attended half of engineering course before dropping out), so it wasn't really misguided choice. I have never been diagnosed, but reading about it's symptoms there's no way I don't have this. Could this have been caused by depression or the other way around?",1

"So I’ve been talking to this girl for months now, I love her and she loves me talked endlessly we wouldn’t hangout as much as we should. She wasn’t ready to date yet which I was okay with I told her I’d wait for her to be ready and she would say like “what if you don’t want me anymore after I’m ready” I’d tell her I would want her, times passes we are the only ones in each other’s mind. She’s been constantly leading me on since she was gonna get better, during that time I told her I couldn’t handle this so I said I was gonna stop talk to her but she begged me to stay which I wanted to her to do lol. More time goes by she said she doesn’t wanna be together and we argued about that. Anyways we still talked like friends and I was hurt over it all bc she didn’t want me anymore.. so invited this girl over which was stupid of me to do I understand that. But we didn’t do anything other than kiss and watch a movie after that I was even more depressed because I still wanted the girl I loved who didn’t have the same feelings as me anymore.. I didn’t talk to that girl I had over after that night. I tell the girl I love that I had someone over and nothing happened but she got upset with me and threatened all these things said were done and basically is acting as if I cheated on her which I didn’t bc she blew me off and said she didn’t feel the same anymore… I asked her why am I the bad guy here ? All I wanted was you but you told me no so out of sadness and depression I had someone over… I hurt everyday for having that random girl over bc now it some how hurt the girl I loved and she saying I’m hers but I’m confused because she said she didn’t want me anymore so why is she mad? Me and her are kinda talking again i still want her and she’s kinda going back to the way we used to talk and calling me every day and every night so maybe she still wants me idk but still is putting up a wall between us… I wanna keep chasing her because I’m so in love with her… so i just need some perspective on this because I’m lost and depressed about it all.",1

"I’ve been essentially dead inside since the age of 7. I tried to kill myself a few times, but I don’t think I really had the fortitude to do it. Mom was to much of an important part of my life I just could t do that to her. So like many of us, I roam the earth like a ghost. But the thing is, it’s still better than being dead. At leas you’ve got tv n stuff. Food has lost all meaning… I’m down to less than 140l s and I’m 6’3. That sucks. But I mean… if you’re out there, and you’re hurting, don’t give up aight? The utter pain, the soulless nights, the terror, all of it, is still worth it. It’s not like it gets better really, but it doesn’t hurt as much. So that’s cool. Love u.",1

"I want a girlfriend, new friends, a better diet, to go to the gym, and to be confident, yet I can't do anything like that. Everything seems so far away, especially getting to the body shape I want and a girlfriend. I tell myself that the body shape is only a couple months away and that there is someone out there for me, my time is coming, yet when it comes down to acting, I don't follow through. I don't know how to even get motivated for stuff like that when I have no enthusiasm or energy to put into it. I don't even have a hobby, I sit in my room doing miscellaneous stuff procrastinating my chores and work. Any advice?",1
"Im bipolar 2 and have extreme ocd, I drink too fucking much and I do way to much drugs. The girl I like made out with me for 2 days told me a ton of shit like ""about how she feels better with me"" and ""she was really looking foward to seeing me"" (this was said while we were sober btw)then the next day telling me it cant go any further. I'm not eating as much, I keep hurting myself (but not in ways that are visble, e.g pulling my hair out and punching myself in the chest/face). I'm just a fat ugly freak. I fucking hate myself",1
"I don't like to gamble much because winning money makes me feel almost nothing, but when I lose it makes me feel bad.

My life is starting to feel the same way. I meet a girl, go through all the excitement of connecting and getting to know each other. It feels so good, and then one way or another she's gone, I fucked things up, I pushed her away, whatever it is the lows are so bad they feel like physical pain that doesn't go away. I started going to the gym, and at first the focus on myself made me feel better but now at best it gets me to neutral.

Up until the last few years I was a pretty even keeled person. Never felt super high or super low, felt in control whether it was relationships or life in general.

After a really intense relationship in 2019 that ended abruptly and painfully, it's like it has stretched out my range of emotions. I feel highs I've never felt before, but the lows are just so devastatingly painful I can hardly take it.

I wake up in the morning feeling anxious and sad. I eat healthy, I walk outside, I talk to friends, but nothing makes it better. I've been using weed to get through the nights, I just keep vaping until I don't feel anything I usually pass out not even remembering how I fell asleep.

I'm managing to keep my business on track, barely, I feel badly for the people who rely on me and my leadership if they only knew the state I was in, but they don't see because I'm still working from home.

I've never feared for my own mental health but I really do. I watched a YouTube video about the signs of serious mental health issues and almost every one was applicable to me.

None of the things that used to make me happy do anymore. Buying things, making money, shallow sexual encounters, the things that used to be 'fun'. The only thing that moves the needle is connecting with someone new and having them like me but that's so much harder to maintain. It takes so long to meet the right person and develop that connection and then it can be gone, or worse in peril, the ups and downs just drag on with the downs so much harder and more painful. I can't make it work but I can't let it go either, it's torture.

I try to talk to my friends about this and they don't want to hear it for the most part. I can't bring it to my family it will worry them too much. I've tried therapy. I feel like nobody can help me, not even myself and I don't know what to do. I'm terrified of pursuing or starting on medication, I'm in my early 40s and it's never even been a consideration before

tl;dr I'm so sad all the time and I don't know what to do about it.",1

"I don't know where to start with. I fear everything, my future and the present. I'm failing all my sophomore classes and I wanted to be good in these classes but I am the worst in them, I have to call and ask my teacher for every little step, he is a kind man but I feel like someone else should of replaced me in the class. I feel like a waste to be taught in the class. I don't want to go to school anymore. I also fear my parents hate me. My dad won't do any activities with me any more and my mom no longer says ""love you"" even when I say it. My dad secretly says what a waste of a son behind my back. My friends don't even want anything to do with me in the past few years. When ever I am with my best friend I always have to put up a smile and try to joke but my jokes seemed to get worse. Whenever I do something I'm proud of and try to show it off to my friends or my parents they just say oh cool. I just want to see my dad be happy what I make when I show him my welding and say what good weld even if it is terrible weld. I just want my parents to be happy when I make or do something. My hobby is gaming I loved it but even with my favorite things to do I suck far worse than anyone. I've had planned on what to do after school many scenarios. I planned on doing steps to insure that my loved ones are ok and many other things than kill myself painless. But now I just want to live my life but I still want to die but what is stopping me is my animals, I care about them far too much. I feel pathetic.

"I'm unsure of what to do in life now. My life is pretty normal, no big issues, and I have nothing to complain about, yet I still feel like this. I moved out of my moms in august and currently live with my two best friends. I don't go out to any social functions, have no girlfriend, no other friends besides the ones I live with and others that are just acquaintances/friends and I don't really talk to them. One of my room mates has a girlfriend while the other sees his family often, I do neither of that. I want to have a girlfriend and have someone love me, but it's so difficult for me to talk to anyone I don't know, and I don't even love myself, in fact, I hate myself. I feel so incredibly lonely and am getting inklings of suicidal thoughts. I have trouble doing any work, especially at night, I just can't motivate myself to do anything and lately it's just been getting worse. I feel that I'll get to the point where I give up. I also feel that a lot of my failures are from my pathetic self pity. I'm insecure about my body and go to the gym, yet I still find excuses to not go at times, thus making me feel bad and then no motivation. My social anxiety is awful and I have no idea how to fix any of that either, it's crippling. Basically what I'm trying to say is that I'm wallowing in my own self pity and I can't get myself out of it. It just gets worse and worse everyday, especially at night when I'm alone with no one to invite over or talk to. If anyone has any advice for me I'd greatly appreciate it, and please don't hold back, If I need a reality check, then please give it to me.",1

"Hello! I’ve been with my husband for 11 years, 3 of those we’ve been married. He’s always been someone who’s quick to negative thoughts. He says he doesn’t enjoy people in general, even though he’s one of the kindest people you’d meet, and always makes people feel welcome/happy. This has been something I’ve learned to counter and navigate with him, and even help him through it in many situations. We have friends together and he has friends of his own who all adore him. My husband has always said he’s not meant for this world, and has often said he wished he didn’t exist. He’s always felt beyond help. About six years ago he attempted suicide, but survived. Since, he’s seemed better. He never got help, but he seemed to be doing alright. He lost his job during Covid, and for a while it seemed like a good thing. He finally got to rest and relax a bit, get away from a job he hated. A year later, though, going back to work is giving him great anxiety, but he doesn’t want to *not* work. I do not expect him to go back to work and have made it clear I’m fine with what’s best for him, but he feels internally he is not pulling his weight and feels he is “ruining my life” because “I deserve better”. No amount of reassurance from me that I am happy and love him and don’t need him to work is making him feel any more at peace. He thinks I just don’t know “what’s good for me”. I suggested therapy, but he feels he is beyond help. I see a wonderful, talented, hardworking and kind individual — as do our friends and family, but he just doesn’t see it. I don’t want to lose my best friend and partner to depression. I myself suffer from OCD and anxiety, but I am lucky enough to not really suffer from sadness. Can therapy help even those who feel hopeless like my husband? Does anyone have any advice? Thank you in advance.",1
"I was in love with my ex girlfriend and she said she loved me too. But she ended up leaving me. And now I’m stuck being alone, I have issues meeting someone new. Because I’m not good looking for online dating

Eventually they’ll get tired of me, they’ll stop trying and they will live their life. I don’t hold it against them, they’re simply doing what is best for them. Even if I don’t have the drive to continue surviving, I’ll do my best to support them from afar, it is the least I can do.",1

"I’m writing this to say I'm depressed. Not like I did badly on a test and I’m sad about it but instead like I wish I could go to sleep tonight and never wake up. I wish I had a way out that wasn’t cutting myself or jumping out my window headfirst. I wish I didn’t have to feel this way, I wish I could enjoy my life without having to think about all the problems that drag me down. Like how I’ll probably never amount to anything in my life, how I’ll end up in a dead end job only making barely enough to live with no one to talk to, hang out with, to talk about how I feel, just me all alone. Or how I’m nobody’s #1 person, the person they go “oh I wonder how he’s doing” or “I want to hang out with him”. I’ve been the other person though, reaching out to people when they feel down to try to cheer them up, that's why I always try to make people laugh. But when I feel sad or alone and I’m waiting for someone to come to me, there’s nobody. I’ve gone through 4 years of a constant cycle of depression, anxiety, low self esteem, self hatred, and a general feeling of uselessness, like I didn't matter. Like if I disappeared tomorrow then nobody’d notice. Of course now I know better, of course they’d notice, they just won’t care. They’d go “Oh he’s not here today? Oh well, not like he was good for anything anyway.” Like today I had a test and I was so done I wrote “flesym llik ot tnaw I” (read backwards). I've been waiting to see if my teacher would send an email or something asking “are you ok, do you want to talk about it?” But no, she hasn’t. I bet she didn’t even understand what I said and just didn’t really care. And before anyone thinks “But dude you’re so lucky in life, how can you be depressed?” Well guess what dude, I am, and you know why, it’s because nice things don’t matter to me. Material possessions are cool but if you feel lonely and empty then they don’t really mean anything, I’d much rather have someone who actually cares about me and how I’m doing instead of a huge house, nice car, all that kinda stuff. All I really want is someone to reach out and try to help me when I’m feeling like this but honestly I don’t really think that will ever happen. The only reason I haven’t done it yet is so I don’t hurt my family because I know they’d be absolutely destroyed if I did but I’m starting to not care about that. I don’t want to feel this way anymore and if there isn't anyone who cares then why should I stay. I don’t want to suffer anymore just to keep other people happy. I would say something like “I’m crying as I write this” but tbh I can’t cry anymore, like there's nothing left there, it's all gone.",1

"To preface I'm on 60mg of prozac and was in therapy until I realised it just wasn't helping.

So I've been depressed for as long as I can remember now, so long that I'm not even sure what life's meant to be like without being depressed. Everytime I feel like I'm getting my head above the water, something comes around which just fucking pushes me back down and drowns me.

Most recently I found out my dad has cancer. Although when I found I didn't feel anything at all, just more empty if anything. He's had surgery now and seems to be on the up, which is great, but it hasn't made me feel any better.

Then my dog died. It was my dad's dog but we got him when I was a kid, and although I knew it was gonna happen eventually it still really fucking sucked because I loved that dog and so did my dad.

Then my girlfriend of 2 years decided she doesnt want to be with me anymore, bare in mind we live together and fuck knows what I'm meant to do now.

All these things on top of the fact I'm in a load of debt, as well as starting to have health problems of my own, have really made me consider taking the easy way out. Only problem is that I'm too scared to do it.

Everything isn't going to be alright. Things aren't going to get better. This isn't just a phase. I'm sick of hearing everyone's attempts to help me. I don't need help. I need a gun to blow my fucking brains out.

Fuck me it's all just so tiring.",1
"I have been on a two years (applying for a third) leave of absence from university due to a **return of my depression and anxiety (i also have ADHD which I take methylphenidate 20mg for) in Nov 2019** which in retrospect may be have been **partly influenced by the stress of being so far behind in my course (2nd year undergrad) which was partially caused by getting distracted with computer games and not doing good prep =&gt; possibility of not getting good grades for Jan exams**. I was on prozac 20mg at the time and had been for 4 years previously. Have tried 8 new medications (mostly antidepressants) during this two years LOA and have not even received a partial response from any of them and thus have made very unsuccessful attempts at getting back into studying during this time. Here is a list of all the meds I have tried **since being originally diagnosed in 2014**
Zoloft - 2014 Remeron - 2014 - 2015: 15 - 45mg **2nd most successful but ""stopped working""**
Prozac - 2015 - 2019: 20 - 40mg **Most successful but ""stopped working"" even when upped to 40mg**
Effexor - 2020
Leaxpro - 2020
Paxil - 2020
Fluvoxamine - 2020
Trazodone - 2021
Melatonin (for sleep) - 2021 **Did not help with sleep**
Antihistamine (for sleep) - 2021 **Partially helped with sleep. Unreliable**
Pregabalin - 2021
Quetiapine - 2021
Doxepin - 2021
I have tried CBT, aswell as a period of being medication free but this just makes me feel more fatigued and just confirms that the bare minimum effect of any medication needs to be additional sleep. Taking all of this into account there are only a few new viable medications left to try; amitriptyline and trimipramine. My father also has depression and has had good success with 40mg prozac for nearly 30 years. That being said I have restarted prozac with the view to going to 40mg fairly quickly and seeing how I respond to the same medication situation but not the pressure of stressful fultime uni course. Its been 2 weeks on prozac 20mg and its given me disturbed sleep which has slightly improved in addition to a temperamental improvement in mood but theres part of me thats not confident about this and any other treatment plan I have. **I am also concerned that even if this prozac restart works and getting a good study prep before finally returning to uni in jan 2023 that I will never get better than a 2:1. I really really want to get a 1st. The thought of my max only being a 2:1 completely kills my motivation to go back to univeristy in Jan 2023,** and thats assuming the prozac restart works in terms of my mood.

"Back in June I kinda sorta ghosted my therapist. Things were going mostly okay until the pandemic hit and I couldn't go to her office anymore. I hated the online sessions and didn't like the way I looked on camera so we did phone calls instead. I still didn't like the fact that I couldn't go in person, felt like I had to filter everything I wanted to say to her because I was at home with my family and didn't want them to hear. Still everything was decent until I missed one appointment by mistake. I scheduled another and then I never got a call back? Then I decided to set out a time to schedule another one but ultimately kept putting it off until I eventually forgot, and got too busy with bad things happening in my personal life that it escaped my mind for a while.


Now all this shit has happened in my family, and on so many occasions ever since my depression got worse somehow. Now it's been months, I still haven't had a session since or even bothered to contact her. Now I'm scared to because I feel bad. She was really understanding too, I want to think she'll understand this but I just feel rude. There's also been so much going on in my life that I fear I won't know what to say when I'm asked. How am I supposed to unpack four to five months of trauma? Where do I even start.",1
"My 15M son is going through it all. Depression, anxiety, not eating or sleeping and now a huge self induced cut down his arm. 
Even with being home during covid shutdown, he did well. Back in FT school and he has a newer group of friends. He still hangs with some of his older friends but there’s a few girls that are new. He said one is helpful because she “goes through the same stuff” and so he feels comfortable sharing with her. But the more I heard her name coming up, the more I saw his issues coming up. 

He had a bad 8ish months summer going into 5th grade (freshman now). Started with not eating going into anxiety then depression. Met a great therapist and things got better. Past few years was just anxiety issues that we all learned to work with and help with. 

He started off this school year really well. Then I started hearing about these 2 girls added in with the friend group and now all of these issues are back along with cutting. 

Could it just be him? Am I wrong to worry about these friends? He says they encourage him to talk to me &amp; school counselor, but the timing of it all makes me question things. He is back with his therapist and we’ll start Zoloft this week",1
"I don't know if this is the proper place to post this, and Im open to suggestions of better sub-reddits to go to for this. I know what I am feeling compared to others is nothing. But I am hoping typing something out here will help me calm down. I am going through a pretty intense bout of self-hatred. I focus on all of my flaws and all of my mistakes. My sexual preferences bring me great shame, which lead into even more self hatred. There was a period of my life that is in my past, but still brings me great pain and shame. I get convinced that I not only will burn in hell, but also deserve it. That I deserve to be punished. Im not particularly religious. I come from a troubled past, where I am an adult survivor of a narcissistic parent who physically, emotionally, and sexually abused people(I witnessed it happen at least once). When I get like this, I cant help but to pick myself apart or think I am a monster like my parent. I'm so shameful of myself, that I cant tell my fiance why I get like this sometimes. My therapist knows my shameful secrets, and thinks I don't 'have anything to hate myself over. But I cant help but think that I am a monster. And this thought spirals me back down into my self hatred. I wouldn't actually hurt myself, but sometimes I get the urge to. The only thing I know to do when I get like this is to ride it out.",1
"I(26 M) just got a new job as a mechatronics and Robotics Tech for Amazon while my girlfriend (25f) lost her job as a secretary at a chiropractor's office. She really doesn't want to work for Amazon again but never went to college and hates the jobs that I suggest. She is an amazing artist and loves everything creative. She is struggling with her depression since losing her job and hasn't been getting anywhere with her job search besides interviews that I think she might be self sabotaging.

I tried to get her to do door dash but she rarely leaves her bed anymore and no longer cares. I'm 8 hours/6 states away from her for the next month on job training and don't know what to do anymore. She doesn't want help from anyone and everyone has been telling her to just go back to Amazon until she can find a better job but she refuses.

I have never felt depression or the anxiety she gets so I feel clueless and helpless. She has been talking to me less and less the longer I've been away. Thanks to everyone in advance for any help and advice",1

"I can’t stop crying. I wake up and immediately just bawl. Everything triggers me and I can’t even bring myself to make conversations because as soon as I speak, I have to cry again. I just go mute and ignore the ones around me. I’m so tired of crying and getting headaches from. I don’t enjoy doing my makeup anymore because I know I’m just gonna cry it off. I don’t wanna go anywhere because I don’t want to end up crying in public and having people try to console me. I just want to stay asleep for as long as I can. I don’t want to feel this way any more.",1
"My brother and I are twins and we're super close.

The difference between us is he has been more significantly effected by depression than I have and it has negatively effected everything from school, jobs and relationships his whole life.

We're 32 now and our lives are quite different. I have a wife, 2 kids, a job, a house, friends, etc. I think the differences in our lives recently only make him feel worse.

Recently, his texts have been worse. No point in living, etc.

I'm not sure how to respond.

For the past 12 years, when he says he's having a bad day. I suggest he does something small like drink water or take a shower. He says he doesn't want advice, just someone to talk to.

For the past 12 years, when he wants to talk, I end up repeating the same things. ""Sorry"", ""That's really tough"", ""I feel you"", ""I'm here for you"". I've said those phrases thousands of times.

Do I just keep repeating the same stuff I've been saying for 12 years over and over. Am I doing this wrong? I have less and less time nowadays, so I can't always be there for him.",1
So I have some friends who have depression and they say they cry a lot but I don’t cry at all. I have been diagnosed with depression but I just feel like there is no point to crying. Its not going to make me feel any better. I would rather just lay in my bed and listen to black metal and just not think about anything. Am I supposed to be crying if I depressed? I know this a really stupid question but I am just wondering.,1

"I spend a lot of time thinking that if some things in my life had been different, I wouldn't be so messed up now. There are a bunch of things but honestly, I think they stem from two big ones:
1) When I was 8, the girl who babysat me molested me. She was 16 at the time, so I go back and forth between ""Well, she was still a kid herself"" and ""Screw that, she knew what she was doing and abused a younger girl entrusted to her care."" I have a lot of trouble trusting people. And I don't like anyone touching me; I tend to involuntarily recoil when someone does. Obviously, few people to be around someone like that.
2) I have strabismus in my right eye. It's the first thing anyone notices when they meet me, and people have constantly mentioned it my entire life. Yes, I'm aware my right eye looks weird because it's not aligned with my left one. I hate it. I've always hated it. I wish I looked normal.
Maybe those two things not happening wouldn't have changed anything. Or much. But I kind of doubt it. I wonder if there's an alternate universe where those things are different and what the me there is like.",1
"Sometimes I wish I could slip away in my sleep but I know I won’t. I know I’ll wake up tomorrow with another opportunity at life. Just as I do everyday. Dying would be the easy way out. The easy way to avoid even the smallest inconvenience in life. I know I can be better but why can’t I apply myself? How do I begin to apply myself? Why can’t I just get up and move? It seems so easy for everyone else so why can’t I do it? I have a feeling that for as long as I struggle with this, life will continue to give me opportunities to get better. It won’t be until I figure it out that it will let me rest. I don’t have a clue as to what can help me. But then again maybe I do, I just prefer it another way. Life can be hard sometimes",1
"Ever since the day I was born I knew I was something different. I knew I wasn’t normal. But I never knew it would come to this.

Ik no one cares but I thought I might as well get it Public. The governorment doesn’t care about you. Your friends they don’t care about you. Unless you got money then it’s just fake love. Because the truth is in the end no one gets judged but you and you alone. So when do go through with it or when it happens Ik I won’t be judged on y’all’s greed or stupidity only my own. And Ik I’m pure I feel like the only angel here on earth. Alone and afraid. Ready to come back home…",1
for the past week or so i've been experiencing some of the worst brain fog and depersonalization i've had in a while to the point where i basically don't feel anything except for rare bursts of emotion. i guess i'm just asking for tips on how to get out of this stretch. anything that helps you feel more connected to life/yourself? and makes you remember why life is worth living? thanks,1
"This feeling grew about three and a half months ago when I left my boyfriend after I found out he had been cheating on me with multiple girls over the years. I remember that morning i was supposed to go to work but instead, I was sitting on the bathroom floor crying and couldn’t stop shaking. 

For the past months I’ve had panic attacks, chronic diarrhoea, cry every day, have stress nose bleeds, and don’t want to go to uni or meet anyone or be away from my mum and I’m 25. I have no friends. 

I tried going out meeting guys off tinder to distract myself at first but it made me feel so much worse and I didn’t enjoy meeting anyone. There’s nothing I want anything from life anymore other than to be next to my mum, the only place that I feel content. Every career I ever dreamed of… I don’t want it anymore. 

I haven’t been happy for a single day these past months. I feel like I’m not living life anymore and I pray that I’ll get cancer and die or get hit by a car. The idea of suicide makes me feel better knowing that I could always choose that any time. 

Every morning I wake up are the most horrific moments of the day. The worst feeling I’ve ever felt in my life of absolute existential dread and anxiety. Being at uni has made it twice as bad. I self harm every few days just to try and get the endorphins going to try and help my brain in some way when I’m too tired and sad to go out.",1
"The story is this:

I was a sensitive kid, but bright, creative and happy, although also generally very anxious and easily led. My parents had a very messy split, including abandonment from my mother which kickstarted bad depression in my early teens. 

My coping mechanism became shutting off most emotional stuff in order to be functional, get a job, survive, and I ended up embracing this side and became a bit of an asshole to be honest, a solid worker but abrasive, sarcastic, and a bit of a bully sometimes. I lost all creativity but I found some fire to stay ambitious and be someone who was, if nothing else, able to stand up for myself.

I was prompted to try therapy after my own family unit broke down, and although it was too late to salvage that relationship, therapy actually was a big success and I rediscovered my sensitivity, emotional intelligence, and ability to connect again, probably saving my relationship with my kids.

I have no desire to return to my old coping mechanism, but I’m kind struggling too. Even though my creativity has come back, and I can recognise my own emotions and connect with people again, anxiety and shyness have also come back with a vengeance.

I feel like I’ve lost that “courage” and resilience I relied on before, and I don’t know how to get just that stuff back without turning back into a wanker. I feel like I’m 13 again. 

Has anyone else had experience with something similar, or any insight on what can be done?",1
"I presented depression symptoms very young. Panic attacks, existential dread, intrusive suicidal thoughts, you name it. I grew up in an affluent white family with more than I could ever need. Every day, I am incredibly grateful to have the financial support that I did not deserve. Literal pure circumstance of the family I was born into. 

So… I was frequently reminded of everything my parents have given me whenever I had depressive episodes and now, as an adult, I’m having trouble validating my own feelings because they were constantly invalidated when I was young. 

I felt that I couldn’t be depressed, I didn’t deserve to feel sad because of what I had. While true to an extent, it still left me grappling with a lot of self hate. 

I’m having a lot of trouble reconciling my feelings with my parents because from a very young age, I’ve felt that I did not ask to be born and didn’t want to be. My mom had me at 39 and was well within her limits to terminate. 

I feel that I’m not allowed to be upset with them considering they’ve paid for so many things, provided me with so much, and are truly loving parents. They were just parenting an HSP (highly sensitive person)/depressed child in the 90’s after being raised by gritty post depression parents 

I don’t know what I’m looking for. Advice? Validation? Similar experiences?",1
"I do not have the energy to keep up with my responsibilities. However, the consequences of not keeping up with them are monstrous, it causes me great anxiety and despair. 

I don't want to die. But I'd like for time to stop, so that I could go in my bed and take a long, long, long nap, and comeback when I'm ready to face the world again. 

But time keeps going, and I always have to keep up. But I'm exhausted. I just want to sleep. But I can't. And that's when suicidal thoughts start making sense to me.",1
"Does this even make sense? I can still sort of think logically but I'm not really functioning. I can recognize that I have some unhelpful and obsessive thoughts, some self-deprecating but I can't really shake them. I'm only barely functioning as it is, I'd argue not really functioning but I can force myself to do a few things now and then.",1

"Everything started with my parent when i was 5, they was alway complaining and fighting because of me. I alway felt its was my fault. I felt my born was a big problem. During my childhood alway had this feeling my parent didnt love me. I was alway alone in my room, crying and so scared. Anxious like it was the end of the world. My father was a drunking bastard who was very angry and yell, broke thing or hit people when he was mad, he didnt wanted spend a single cent for me or my mother. Why? i understandood later because he wanted save his money to leave us and make a new life with someone else. And he did. He started to left my mom. And after he left me by moving very far with a new woman and her kids, they all rejected me, expect his girlfriend (she alway been nice to me, idk if its was fake or real). I was very sad the day i saw all picture of my father, his gf and her kids, but not mine... I was completly broken. I supose nobody would be proud of a shit like me. My mom recently told me indirecly that my father was manipulative and lie to her, to get her in his bed. and now im here i guess, me the biggest error of their life.
&amp;#x200B;
When i was young he alway looking at me with hate, and he was never satisfied with anything i do. He had a high QI and he was the best of his school. He was not satisfied with my result (i was very good at school 90%-95%, something like that but not 100% like him). Someone told me later he probably wanted to destroy me because he was scared of me, scared i became better than him. and i guess he got what he wanted. When i was young i was alway with my friends families, i was squatting their family. Because i had none. I was a kind of nomad, travel from family to family, trying to beg some love. but im not their kids, they dont love me. I passed so many chrismass in other family, smiling in apparence with a tear in my eye. Just wishing to have a family who love me for who i am. I had the excuse to be just a kid, i cant really do that anymore. Illusion is gone now, i will never had a family or anybody.
&amp;#x200B;
At school i decided to not do anything, i hated school, and my result was very bad, because i wanted my parent to pay. but its my own life i fucked up. Almost everybody at school was bulliying me, i was alway come back home with bleeding nose. I didnt understood why, i was quiet, in my corner, not doing anything to anybody, trying to not take too much place. Apparently its may be the law of attraction, my problem at home attracted people to hate me for that (life is so nice they said). Or maybe they was just jealous, who knows, thank to them now i have borderline and severe social anxiety. I was bullyed from primary school to high school and at work later.
&amp;#x200B;
My parent divorced when i was 14. my father try to make me drop out school to not pay to my mom. he also wanted to kick me out of the house. i quit at 16 when he punch me in the stomach when he was drunk. and 1 day later he remove all furniture and stuff in my room and make a nice office for him and he was proud of it, like i was nothing and i guess he was right...
&amp;#x200B;
i been on street a bit. but my mom took me. When i was young i alway feel my mom didnt love me. she was so cold. When i was 16 i was living with her and she had a severe depression, she didnt left her room for a year or something. i started to be very revolted, i became a punk. i was so angry and feeling so empty i started to drink. 24 beer or 60 oz every day for 8 years. with various hard drugs. at first was fun. after i wanted to die by alcool and drug intoxication, i failed. and my mom kick me out from the house, i was back on the street for a while. Passing out somewhere in a dark alley or in the street. I took my backpack and travel a bit. I had alot of friend at this time. Alcool was a big problem for me.
&amp;#x200B;
I ended up in hospital 9 time for suicide, 3 could be critical. Than they trow me in one of those psychiatric therapy. i was scared. I left after 14 days with my backpack. my mom took me back, I wanted quit drink but I continue, because i was bullyed at work by a jerk at this time. I quit my job and I quit alcool and drug by myself now. Didnt saw my friends for years. &amp;#x200B;
Now i cant socialize, i cant make friends, cant make girlfriend, cant have a job. Im lucky to have my mom who still suport me, i realize she love me recently, but i think she dont alway know how to love, she have a bad life herself. We cant give what we never had i suppose.
&amp;#x200B;
now im almost 40.
After 15 years of loneliness, I really miss my friends, i miss when i drink because i was able to talk to people. I miss them so much. i never been able to make other friend after. I supose they made alot of new friends and forget me fast. i could not, i still always think and dream of them :(
&amp;#x200B;
I had a best friend for 15 years but he betrayal me. And now i cant trust anybody. Im broken.
&amp;#x200B;
I have no self estime, no self confident, i hate everything about myself. I just stay alive to not make my mom surfer more. And she alway mad at me when im not smiling. sorry mom, i did what i could with the shitty cards i had.... I do make nightmare alot, and anxiety panic. Im so scared of crowd and group. who would be friend with a wreck like me? pfff
&amp;#x200B;
people tell me to recover and i should go over it, i try very hard, but i feel its a part of me they took me, im suffering for so long that i dont remeber to had this missing part inside of me, its just lost forever... and its getting worse

"Sorry, I'm new to posting on Reddit, so excuse the formatting.
So I (21F) live with my parents as I am still in post-secondary and not working currently. Now let me say this in the beginning so that no one gets me wrong, I love my parents and they have done everything for me and provided everything. However, they don't think depression is a good enough reason to be able to do something. Now when I get into extremely bad depressive episodes, they can last for a week or longer. meaning that getting up from bed, brushing my teeth, showering, keeping my room clean can get extremely challenging. So that's one thing they already get angry with me for. And I've tried explaining how my depression affects the things I do but it's always the same. And I understand it's from them being immigrants and having the years they should've enjoyed used to work and support their family. So seeing a kid, who hasn't been uprooted from their home at that age. doing things they should be doing in a normal living circumstance, they don't understand them. And every day I'm compared to other family members' kids and how I should be a certain way and how much better I could be if did things differently in my life and it just makes me feel more like shit. The only happiness I get is from the kind of outlandish things for brown immigrants, which are tattoos and piercings, art, and music. And out of consideration, I tried to find ways to work around them, like getting body-safe markers and drawing the tats myself or getting fake piercings but even those I got in so much trouble for. I used to cut and lately, it's feeling like I'm going break soon and go back to that so i thought maybe someone on Reddit who can relate or even just someone who wants to be sad with someone could help ease the thought",1
"So I met a girl that says she has depression with two other disorders for 3 years. I want to be friends with her because she seems super cool but I’m scared I might do something that will make her not want to talk to me.

Basically I just want any tips around this subject because this person is really nice and I don’t want to hurt or annoy her.

Tnx to everyone in advance!",1
"This is my literal first post on reddit. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel lonely and trapped in life.
My mental state wasn't ever something you could call ""good"". I'm extremely neurotic by default. I've experienced bullying at school, unemployment and dropped out of college due to isolating myself for half a year ages before the pandemic. Last year I moved to another city all excited and wanting to be the best version of myself and all that other bs. Unfortunately meanhwile my country (Poland) decided to turn into some weird ass catholic-fascist regime that wants to leave the EU. I don't know how many of you are aware of the situation in Poland, but trust me when I say it is pure madness. The ruling party is either clinically insane or is just acting that way but it's really bad nonetheless. Literal fascists are marching happily through the capital with the blessing of the ruling party, women die because of the anti-human abortion law, the pandemic is killing thousands because the ruling party doesn't want to make the anti-vaxxers angry and all these poor people stuck on the Belarus-Polish border... and don't even get me started on how much money the party stole from us. We'll be a Russian puppet state in a blink of an eye at this rate. And the ruling party treats us all like complete idiots telling in their tv propaganda that everything is awesome. I can't deal with this. I don't know how I can deal with this. I can't just ""not watch the news and don't care"" because I DO care. But I can't do much about it. For the last year I've had panic attacks and insomnia just trying to figure out ""WHAT'S NEXT?"". I want to get out of here so badly, but I really don't know how. What's even worse, my partner left work all of a sudden. We were working together in a small company and he left to a literal big corporation. This shook my world somehow though I can't really explain why. I guess I'm just jealous. We had many fights over this and my relationship is now hanging on a string because I'm a terrible person. But he made me take a week off work just because he had some free time. I actually believed everyone who told me that some time off would be good for me, but nope. I didn't rest at all. I think I lost that ability. If anything it made me more anxious. He keeps telling me my reactions aren't normal, that I'm probably depressed and need medication. I agree to some point, but I still have reservations against meds. I've took antidepressants before when I was in a much worse point in life and I have a pretty good experience with them, but... But. I don't feel like it's an ""illness"" because I've felt worthless, pessimistic and self-hatred my whole life. I literally don't know what would I become if all this is taken away from me. I've came across reaserch that medication cuts neurotism by x7 times and raises extraversion... so if I'm a neurotic introvert it will definetely tamper with my personality. I don't like that idea. Therapy is out of question, because I can't possibly afford it and I tried so many times and always failed miserably. Also I feel like being happy would somehow legitimate the ruling party's regime. With all this bad stuff going on I feel like feeling bad about it is the least I could do. The problem is there is so much... I'm overstimulated. And exhausted. I've never felt so exhausted in my life. I don't know what to do.
Also, you must know that I'm an unwanted child. I've been told very clearly that my mom would've gotten an abortion if my grandma and my dad didn't ""stop her"". I have no idea what went down there, it's not impossible that there was some abuse going on... How can I feel about this? How can I even think that I could lead a happy life? I think it would be unfair to my mom who suffered so much just because I had to exist... I don't know... I've had suicidal thoughts for a long time now, I think that just dissapearing would solve literally everything and everyone would be glad when I'm gone. The thing is I'm too much of a coward. I don't know what to do... I think I'm destined to have a life full of misery and pain. I think like taking meds would somehow cheat this destiny. I hate life. I hate myself. And I hate Poland as it is. I see no way out of this hellhole.",1
"Freedom and Failure
Why do I feel like such a failure?
I am Free
I am a failure
Am I just looking for ways to relive me from my Freedom?
I feel like shit
Force myself to be made successful
Is that the root of my OCD?
So many questions
Won't be able to find a real answer to any of them
If I am happier when I get enough sleep, why am I always sleep deprived?
My heartbeat sounds like footsteps 
It often frightens me when I'm alone
I must've masturbated like 5 times today
Only to grow the empty void inside of me
Will I ever be happy?
I have yet to see the light at the end of the tunnel

Lately I've had ""episodes"" where I feel like I slip out of reality
It makes life feel so distant
It mostly makes me confused 
How can matter exist?
How does everyone pretend, or think, that this life is normal?
These episodes started to occured so often that it just feels like I sometimes slip back into reality and start to believe in this dream again.

I need something to happen
I don't want to live my life like this
I am Free and I Failed.
Help me

Why am I a failure?
The ONLY reason people think I'm successful at what I do is because of my genes.
I'm poor
Unloved
Unliked 

Maybe some day I'll live the life I seek
Not because of my effort

Does reality exist out of my head?
Am I all there is?
Is this all there is?

I want to be heard
I want to be understood",1

I wake up while I don't will doing so and I go to sleep while I don't will doing so.
Today one of my friends asked me if I ate anything during the day, it was nearly 4 pm and only when they asked, I figured out I forgot to eat. 
It feels like I'm a robot. I wake up to the same routine everyday but it feels like I need to repair myself before I just stop working completely.. You probably know how it feels like, right? I need a serious break from anything but I already create too many breaks for myself. I even binged some series on Netflix and avoided any work to do.

They always tell you to treat everyday like it's your last day, but for me? I don't even manage to enjoy any day for more than a year. Everyday feels like forcing myself to get out of the bed.",1
"I met a girl about 2 months ago through a dating app and we made a great connection. We both have a very simple, non-materialistic world view that seems very rare to find these days and we share so many similarities in personality. She is kind, caring, responsible, pretty, good professional career, everything a guy could want in a woman. I could easily see myself having a happy, long term relationship with her.
The problem is she is 41 and wants kids, so time is not on her side. She even had her eggs frozen previously a few years back for this. I'm 34 and not feeling strongly prepared for kids at this point in my life. I may want them one day, but that is as good as a no considering the time problem. I want her to be happy and she wants the same for me so we agreed to be friends.
She has been through a lot with an abusive childhood and moving to a country where she doesn't really have family or a support network. I don't have a big network either, but I do have family that is not terribly far and one or two odd friends I see sometimes. In fact she left her previous husband of many years, because he didn't want kids. Needless to say she deserves to have the family she wants.
Now I got invited by a different friend to check out an arcade last night which is in the same complex next to where our first date was. So I walked through the area and retraced some of our activities. I guess I should have avoided, because this triggered some sadness in me. She told me she just went out with a guy and said he pretty much has everything she is looking for. Now I'm sitting here crying over missing out on a relationship with an amazing person. I really do hope she finds happiness, but can't help but be sad right now.
I realize this is probably pretty small compared to some of the terrible things that happen to people and some of the things I've read here. I have a lot of things to be thankful for, but I just needed to vent. I suppose I should just minimize contact and not risk making things any more difficult for her at this point.",1
"What is the point of fighting to go on when I'm already so broken down. I have had depression for years, these are not new feelings but they seem to be getting worse because instead of feeling very emotional over it, I'm starting to feel tired and apathetic to my own pain. I have always wanted to die every day of my life, hoping some freak accident would happen so my family wouldn't also bear the pain of a suicide (plus I know that I couldn't go through with that anyways). But now I'm a mom and I have pushed those feelings down because I'm obviously not allowed to have those thoughts as a parent. 
 I'm a new stay at home mom, and I thought this was what I wanted because working always stressed me out in the past and I didn't want to take on more responsibility for fear of failure. I think I can be a good mom, and of course I'll love my child and be my best self for them......
But now I'm just terrified that I'm nothing. Without a job what purpose does my life have. While being a mom is great, that becomes significantly less important in 18 years. If I do everything right I will have a child grow into an adult who doesn't need me everyday, and that's great. But then what do I do with my life. In order to get a job you need experience, and references. Both of which I will lose over time. So getting a job later on only becomes significantly harder, if not impossible. 
I could try to convince myself that a career isnt important to the meaning of life, but then what is? I have things I know a lot about and I feel I'm smart, but I also have a husband who has to be right about everything and constantly (though I don't think he's aware of when he's doing it) makes me feel incredibly stupid. I could try to read and follow the news and make myself a more rounded enducated person, but when do I have the time for that anymore, not to mention that fact that that can be a depressing way to spend the few minutes I do have to myself.
I could go back to school and get my master's, as I enjoyed school, but what's the point of spending all that money if I'm not going to go into a career field. 

I feel like all I am and will be now is a mom. Which don't get me wrong, I asked for, and I will do everything in my power to do that job well and learn from my parents, but damn does it feel dehumanizing.",1
"CW: Suicide &amp; suicide ideation -
I’ve dealt with suicide ideations since I was around 9. I can still remember the incident that triggered my first suicidal thought, and what I was wanting to do. Many, many years later, I still struggle with ideation. Even on medication, even with therapy. They’re not always there, and they’re not always the same intensity. When they’re not there, I feel like it’s just in remission, just like my depression is in remission. Has anyone else struggled with suicide ideations since childhood, and if so have you ever got to the point that you’re confident the thoughts have gone away for good? Is this something I’m always going to have to manage and be susceptible to?",1
"My english isn’t so good, and i’m feeling stupid right now, not at 100% of my abilities, ngl. I’ve been having episodes since i was 13, to which my mother always responded me to go pray( i come from a religious family) or to just stop, and my father never really cared…. Or asked. 
Now i’m 20 and it’s been a year since i haven’t been sad. A whole fucking year wow! A whole year just to end up crashing even harder. What a mess! 
And now i have to re-live everything, and i’m mad, i’m sad and have no one to talk to. 
My question is: will i ever be able, someday, to live without the weight of god knows what? Will i ever be able to recover? Will i ever be able to have a boyfriend? To not be jealous of my successful loving brother? To enjoy going out with friends? Am i doomed forever?
God i sound stupid i’m sorry but i really have to talk to someone.
I really don’t want to sound like a brat but i can’t help just to feel like it. I hate my life. And reading what i just wrote made me even sadder.

"Hello everyone

So I'm a 4th year (final) medical student and my problems are probably going to sound very first world-y. When I started out college I was really compassionate with a strong sense of right and wrong, always put my friends/boyfriend/god/family first. Over these 8 years (med school+ premed), the insane competition has really made me loathe myself and everyone around me. I think of everything as a resource, whether time or dating or friendship and doing anything pleasurable makes me guilty. We have been trained to think that anything human: like taking a day off/ having kids/ getting anything over a month of maternity leave/ going on dates/ etc. makes us lazy... and I feel like this mentality (that has been forced on me by American medicine) has made me an asshole.

I really really do care for patients and would always worry for their best interest, that might be the last good thing left about me, but other than that, I feel like med school has removed anything nice that ever existed in me. 

Is there anything that you guys can suggest that can help me reach normalcy again?",1
"Hello, I'm 23 currently taking Architecture living in an 3rd world asian country. I took my course because its what my father wanted. Me and my father eventually fought, and it ended up in me being diagnosed with Bipolar disorder. When I was 19 I left my dad, currently with my Mom and her family. I eventually liked my course, now that I'm in my 5th year it changed. It started over the years, I've always been compared to our relative. Who is already an Architect, female and ace of her class. From the progress, grades, and every little thing was compared. Even though I'm one semester ahead of my batch as an advanced student, and studied 2 schools at a time (one from my main school and one from CAD training school). I felt so sad as if I'm living on someone's shadow. And every achievement I make is still not enough and still being compared. And every failure I encountered, I got told that if our relative who is a female had made it. Why can't I. 

Right now I want to quit my course, but afraid to tell my family. I fear that the money and time they have invested in me might turn to a waste. I fear that I'll be branded as a failure and a garbage. But at the same time crippled at the pressure my family is throwing at me. As everyone is rooting for me to finish my college degree. I'm considering my options if I'll drop out and take another course or just quit to work. I just want to be happy and not be a puppet.",1
"Kinda new to this sub, I don’t really have anyone to express these types of emotions to so I’ll leave it all in here for everyone to see. I’ve suffered with depression and anxiety for years now, since 2017 and have been on medication for a while…Whilst it helps now and again I don’t feel myself and recently I have been so low to the point I’ve been trying to figure out ways to take my own life which are quick and easy. I know it’s crazy but most days I’m SO low and dead inside. I feel like I’ve ruined my only life god has given me and taken everything for granted. Although I am changing and becoming a better person day by day there’s a part of me which feels like I deserve to die, but I am also very harsh on myself… 

I dunno, it’s a tough one. I don’t wanna upset anyone in my life, I just feel it would be better with me gone?",1
"You’re in your adult years. Your last few years of your life have been a slow motion car crash in autopilot.

I’ve never been able to hold my side of the bargain in relationships, or friendships. I’m terrified of commitment. I’m terrified of enclosed domestic spaces. I’m terrified of control. I’m terrified of people. I don’t want to be alone. But I don’t want anyone around me. I love everyone. But I also hate everyone. I will always cheerlead people. And in my head I’m gasping for their failure. I’m in so much pain from various abuse I’ve been through in my life. My PTSD diagnosis was no shock to me. Still haven’t got any help with that though. I wasn’t given the opportunity to revoke consent and I never will be. I’ve never got any of my trauma rectified, and never got any closure. I’ve never put my trauma first, always the trauma of others. It was so many years ago. But it haunts me. 

I hurt a lot. But I’d never ever try to hurt someone intentionally. I just, don’t enjoy hurting people.

People always tell me I’m a nice person. I really try. I never EVER mean to hurt people. I always want to help others, make them feel great, make them feel comfortable and looked after. But I’ve never managed to make it happen. I always fuck up. I can’t hold relationships. I can’t hold friendships. I always let people down. They get mad. They split hairs, look deeper, analyse all my choices, actions and decisions, and realise I’m just not worth the effort. Or it would make a great social media hit piece. Get your friends in on it too. Sometimes they’ll lie, blow things out of proportion, over analyse and drag me through the dirt. 

I’ll never defend myself from various accusations. Why bother? I’ve rolled through the punches. Say whatever you like about me, say whatever you want about me, say whatever story you’ve got to your friends, followers, family, why should I care when I can just blow my brains out and get this shit over and done with? No-one will listen to my nuances. No one will listen to my sides of the stories. No one cares what I said, or did, people made their minds up already. It just doesn’t matter. I’ve never been given the chance to improve. I can’t get help to fix my issues when everyone turns me away and I’m being harassed and targeted at so many different corners. Getting mental health help in my state is impossible. I’m going to have to take the long road, or give up.

I tell myself I have the capacity to open up my heart and take care of people, and make a change. But at the same time, I’m crumbling inside. Some friends see the raw side of me and I wonder why people leave me so often. I’m not okay.

I have some friends that have pledged to be by my side. Help me face my demons. Be there for me. Show me love. Show me happiness. And they do it. But I am fucking terrified one day I’ll let them down too. I don’t know what actions or trauma made me this way. 

I approach new people with a different side of me so that I can try and plug the void I’ve created with fresh plaster. But I barely even trust anyone? Why do I do it? What if they’re all just feeding back to the same people that made it very clear the only thing I can do to heal their wounds is cease to exist. I’ve had people fake friendships with me since everything happened, while I was in a vulnerable state, only to get more gossip on me, find out my location, my state, and more.

I thought I made so much progress. I thought I was growing. I thought I was changing as a person. I made new friends, I started living a new life. And recently when I hooked up with a friend, I froze after we were doing it. I thought we were having a good time. But, something happened during it. I backed away from them. I couldn’t move, I couldn’t think. I couldn’t provide them the aftercare they wanted after our session. They broke down. I didn’t know what to do. I spiralled. I tried to make it right, I DEFINITELY wanted to take care of them, I just freeze during, or after sex. A day later, I lost that friend forever. They told me how they /really/ felt about me. I didn’t suspect a thing. I never knew they saw me that way. I always thought (and was told) I made them feel comfortable and looked after, I never ever could have thought I’d have hurt them. I cut my losses. I walked away from it, I let the love go. 

Being told by someone close you loved a lot, wanted to take care of, spent so much time with, adored in so many ways…. how they feel you’ve neglected, hurt and belittled them during your time together breaks you in every way imaginable. I keep trying to be my chirpy, happy self in front of everyone. I’m trying so hard. But I’m falling apart. Everyone knows me to be this happy chirpy person who’s this fun cheerleader and I just can’t do it anymore. 

Being falsely accused of sexual assault in the past has created a situation where I now cannot have a healthy sex life. I can’t get hard. When I do, I can’t stay hard. I just can’t do it. Sex is completely ruined for me, all I get is thoughts of the person that gave such a different story to the one I wasn’t able to tell. What if my potential partners are agreeing to sex with me only to regret it later? What if I’m meeting up with people that don’t want to do it with me, but they do it anyway? I’ve never forced someone once in my life. I’ve never been aggressive. I’ve always asked. I’ve never coerced anyone. I’ve only ever been kind, asked, and respected consent. I’ve misread signals before. But I’ve always apologised and been respectful.

I’ve had friends and previous partners tell me the behaviours Ive taken ownership of to improve don’t exist. I’m not this person I’ve painted out in my head and I’m not this person I’ve been told I’ve been before. But who the fuck do I believe? I surely can’t be hurting some people and doing the opposite for others if I have NO intention of hurting people? I can’t be expected to go back and fix every single incident because I have to recount so much trauma. Relationship trauma, environment trauma, other trauma, rage, anger, emotions, I can’t face people anymore. I can’t explain myself. I can’t explain every little micro interaction I’ve had with people. I’ve been analysed to an amount where I just can’t hold a valid discussion about myself or my actions with anyone anymore.

So as I can’t explain any of my actions to people, differentiate what happened from what didn’t, I can’t explain myself, I can’t defend myself, I can’t protect new friend and potential partners, I often think about killing myself. I tried. It was tantalising. So fucking tantalising. I took myself to remote places to try and feel better being alone for once, but life called me back. The thought of being able to release myself from all this pain, making those in my past happy with being able to read about my death, allowing everyone to finally move on and leave me alone is absolutely stunning. I really, really want it. I just constantly keep making excuses for myself or meet people who promise it’s worth it to keep going, who tell me I’m changing, who tell me that I’m not that bad, who tell me that I can fix things, that tell me that I can just move on, that I can be different, 

I don’t know. I’m rambling. I’m venting without thinking. I’m writing down whatever’s in my head so I don’t do something more harmful to myself. I’m not going to kill myself. I don’t know why. I don’t know who I am, where I am, or how I’m going to get myself out of this mess, but….",1

"I have not a great past. Not great childhood,highschool or university experiences. I'm gonna graduate next month and nothing about my university life satisfy me. For last 1-1.5 month,my daily routine is eat,sleep and sleep. Few times I go out with my friends I need to add that. I don't wanna leave my room. I don't wanna continue the life or growing. 

Every night, before sleeping my thoughts making me feels like my chest gonna explode and want to cry but I can't. I don't want a life that needs to give my 12-14 hours to work and in return never get anything. Cuz in my country life is sucks and expensive.Our minimum wage is 290 dolar and %45 of people working for that money while that money under starving money. Possibly terrible social life,loneliness,poverty and loss of my loved ones awaiting me in futures and I can't see a escape route or salvarion from these cycles. I don't believe I have a good future and change somethings and create a life for me that I can be happy and peacefull.

I don't know what to do how to do. Right now im in my room while these thoughs sieged my mind.I already seeking my therapist every week but. depression with sheer truths hurts so much. I wan't a life that im a good husband to lovely woman with one or two children,nice or good place enough to called home,nice pay,holidays with my family,camping together,events with friends and money to these while I can have time to spend to myself.

"I started college a while ago, made no friends yet (or maybe at all) I'm also not doing very well financially and struggling with work. My mental health has not been well since before school due to continuing crises in my relationship. Going to work has undoubtedly made it so much worse, I think about suicide daily, Im constantly worried about my financial situation and I'm deeply depressed the nights before school. I already quit a different program last year for different reasons, my mom was fighting cancer the entire time I was in school and at some point I just started slacking and losing interest in my studies. I'm thinking about taking this year off to save money and go to therapy but im scared these are all excuses for me to procrastinate and deal with the problems I have. My age also plays part as I'm getting older and keep seeing my friends graduate while I'm still struggling to even start which makes my condition worse. I talked to my boyfriend a lot and he offered to help financially but I'm still struggling with the idea and everything else that prevents me from wanting to go. I'd love any advices and insights you have to offer.",1

"I've kinda not had the best time in the last few months and it doesnt look like its gonna get any better. My friend group is kinda falling apart, one of my friends in that group started dating my most recent ex less then a week after we broke up without talking to me beforehand, my dad has been diagnosed with a genetic disfunction which probably is gonna shorten his live by 20 years and i cant bring up the energy to do good in school. Also there is this girl I've been talking to but its really not going good. I have been told many times by other people that I am very good at analyzing people but I cant for the live of my figure her out. She actually initiated by inviting me to meet her at her volleyball practice because we met over the summer playing beach volleyball. She asked me to come like an houre before it started so i sayed that would come the week after that because i have very bad social anxiety so i need a good 1-2 day notice before i do something to mentaly prepare. But then the next week she was sick and the week after that she declined last second because she forgot she was invitrr to a friends party. Well due to me being paranoid and a fucking idiot i stop texting her because i got the feeling that this isnt gonna go anywhere and it just made me more depressed talking to her. But after a month of being depressed and thinking of what could have been i texted her again. Now at this point i had fully ghosted her for a month and didnt expect an anwser which would have been fine with me because then i could have finish with the thought that mabey there still is a chance. Im a person who every time when i had a crush on someone either we ended up toghether or i got a big fucking rejection. But I like getting rejected more than the relationship just getting lost in the wind. Anyhow she did ignore me for two days and then suddenly started texting again like nothing happaned. And she also does all the little things I usually use to identify if somebody is interested in me but when i ask if we still wanna meet up she kinda shoots me down. Or at least thats what it feels like. For example i asked if she still wants to make plans but her awnser was that she cant because she has a lot of stress during exam season. :| A day later she went out with her friends. I fully understand that her friends a more importand than a random friend of a friend she has been texting with. Well actually Im a friend of her best friends ex boyfriend so mabey i dont have the best starting hand :)
Ion know. I fully understand if she doesnt want to meet up but id at least want to have the respect to actually tell me that. 
Yeah anyways I dont think anybody will even read this this far but ive dug my hole and dont want to keep goind bc its just gonna get deeper :)",1
"When I was younger and I was diagnosed with depression. There was nothing that that really helped me. I started smoking because of the relaxing feeling of being by myself in an open space with nothing around me. Many people avoid those that smoke, whether that be the smell or the stigma behind it. Which of course smoking does lead to health issues. I'm not disputing that what so ever.

After a couple years of dealing with depression, going on meds and seeing a therapist. I decided to quit. Thinking that I didn't need them. Which I didn't and I still don't. It's been a few years and the cravings come and go. It's one of those things that just stays with you.

I don't know if this is the place to post this. But whenever I think of smoking. I always think of where I was and what I was going through at the time.

Thank you for listening",1
"I think I was molested by my older sister, and I’m not sure what to do because I have a close relationship with her. All I remember was that I was either 2-4 years old, and she was either in junior high or a freshman in high school at the time (she is 12 years older than me, and I’m 21. She is currently 33). I remember being in her room at my grandmother’s house and it was like morning or afternoon; I remember her touching all over my chest and genital area but I wasn’t sure what was going on. I remember her saying oohs and yeahs while she was doing it, and it was kind of sexual.

I’ve been having these flashbacks of this happening since I was in middle school, but I’d push them away because I don’t know if this actually happened. I’ve been through a lot of abuse in my life as well (with my stepmother sexually abusing me along with her niece, and my dad enabling their behavior and physically abusing me as well), but with my own older sister who’ve I’ve always looked up to and I love her to death, I’m literally fucking disturbed and I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I should tell my mother because all three of us have a close relationship; my mother, sister, and grandmother are the only family I really have, and we are all close. I trust my mother, but I don’t know if I should tell her at all. And I love my sister to death, but I don’t know how to process this.

I literally processed this 2 hours ago while I was in class. I was in a depressive state today, and I was in my music theory class. I tried to make myself feel better by drinking a cup of chai tea and a bread loaf, but this popped up randomly and I’m starting to realize that this actually happened. So I literally ended up breaking down in class, and I feel embarrassed because I don’t want to look like an attention seeker. I’m already having a rough semester so far with my mental health, the fact that I may not finish school by next winter since I’m not sure if I can pay off my past due balance, and just the fact that I hate being here in this whitewashed PWI in which you feel like as a POC you have to conform to the standard of whiteness here or you’re seen as the angry POC student with no ambition (this school has also put me through a lot of trauma to the point in which majority of the student body resorts to drinking and drugs to cope being here since it’s literally nothing here). But this is just one add up to the shit that I’m trying to heal from, and I am fucking traumatized.",1
I am 14 I think i have depression I told my mom about it like 2 weeks ago and she has only brought it up around 3 times and just kinda forgot about it I think because I keep lying and saying I’m fine but I’m really not it’s been 3.5 years I’ve felt like this the past few months I’ve been having suicidal and self harm thoughts multiple times throughout the day almost everyday.

"On paper, I have a pretty great life. As a decent looking married white man in his 40s, making a six figure salary and a pretty awesome wife, no one would guess this about me. But it is all just a front for me. I have been wanting to not exist since my early teens. But my parents fought hard for me as I had a rare disease as an infant that was the 1 in a Million chance to be cured. And as much I want to stop living, I cannot put them through that. My wife will be fine, she loves her work+friends+family and is a practical person. She will eventually move on though I admit it won't be easy for her. At least we aren't having kids, thank you vasectomy. I never wanted to get married but I was weak and she would have left me if I hadn't so I did. But we have been having the usual marriage rut and I am contemplating divorce so she does not have to suffer down the line.
And I have been to therapy, taken the pills, done all the ""right"" things. But no one who isn't you ever gets it. How hard it is to wake up, to keep doing the things. I am a high functioning depressive, I don't let myself falter, I just wake up every single day and do what is expected of me. At work, at home, with family. And while I have had moments of happiness, I just don't see the point of life. Death is the only inevitable truth of every life. Why should I keep going when I don't want to? For someone else? Why should they have more ownership of my life than myself? They don't have to live my life, I do. And if I don't want to, then shouldn't that at least be my decision?
For every teenager reading this, I wish I could tell you it gets easier. But honestly you just learn to live with it better. There is no ease, there is no comfort. There is just existing, waiting until you don't have to",1
"It's truly suffocating. All existence coming down on me. No moment of relief whatsoever. This persistent sense of dread that can't be masked by anything.

We know all this, we also know that at the peak of it, there's no moment to breath. I wish it makes sense. I wish I just disappear instantly and permanently at the moment but I know this isn't happening.",1

"I’m 20 year old girl. I had a really rough year (2020) when I was diagnosed with GPA, had 2 heavy surgeries, was on chemo and been to hospital for around 7 months. I’m on immunosuppressants rn and many other meds. It’s not that I’ve been happy before that happened, but I had nothing real to complain about, so I stayed silent. Ever since I’ve been really bad, I’m just empty, I almost don’t eat at all, I hate how I look because I became way too thin and people started noticing, my hair is thinner cause I lost almost half of it, I even dropped out of uni, my major was math and I feel extremely stupid because I can’t concentrate for the hell of it. My room is a mess, I barely sleep and don’t hang out with anyone anymore, although my friends really are there for me, I just feel like I can’t open up at all. I visited psychiatrist and she told me she doesn’t wanna rush with diagnosis but believe I have some form of PTSD (from almost dying) and depression. I haven’t visited her since and it’s been 8 months, I just don’t have strength to do that and private psychiatrists are expensive in my country so I can’t afford it.. Please give me any advice I just can’t go on",1
"So I am looking for insight on this topic and figured I’d ask the opinions of people who are struggling with this disorder.


My husband and I have been married a little over 2 1/2 years. Our whole marriage he has struggled keeping jobs. He loses a job every one to two months due to arriving late and missing days a lot. This puts us in a very bad place every time, with me having to scramble and sometimes borrow money from my parents to pay the rent and other bills for the month until he gets another job.


I understand that is a result of his depression. What I don’t understand is that every time he loses a job he lies to me about it. For example, recently he lost a job and rent was due the following week. I didn’t know he had lost the job so I asked him multiple times if he would have his half of the rent, every time I asked he said yes. He took me to an expensive festival that weekend despite my repeated questioning if he was able to afford it with rent being due, he said yes. When we got there his card kept declining even for small purchases. I got fed up and demanded I see his bank account history. There were no deposits from a job in there anytime recently. At that point I knew he had lost yet another job.


The problem is that that exact scenario happens every time he loses a job. He pretends to still have one until the rent comes up and he can’t pay it. He will wake up early in the morning and leave the house to convince me he is still employed. I’m always understanding and supportive when he loses a job so I don’t understand why he feels the need to lie to me about it. He claims his dishonesty is yet another result of his depression. Is that true or is he making excuses?


Side note, he has a prescription for medicine and used to see a therapist, but hasn’t seen a therapist in a long time and prefers to spend his money on weed instead of buy his $15 medication.",1
"After many years of undiagnosed and untreated depression, I’ve finally been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and anxious distress. I’ve never sought treatment or therapy before (I thought my suicidal thoughts would just go away) but after many nights of planning out suicide I decided to get help. Now, I don’t know what to expect. What happens if the antidepressants they’ve prescribed me
don’t help? I’m afraid to even take them in case they make my situation worse, or don’t help at all - because then what? That was my last shot at a normal life. How does starting antidepressants for the first time feel?",1
"So, I want this existence end... Ive never actually tried commiting suicide, but I've been less careful about things that could kill me. Things like not looking both ways before crossing the street, riding my bike recklessly, not using blinkers, taking medication on an empty stomach, silly things of that sort I suppose, but with serious intent. I've started to eat very little, how long does it take to starve? I've tried to just stop breathing, doesn't work... Ive tried telling my heart to stop beating, didn't work... tried to catch covid but i think I'm asymptomatic. What is a good way to greatly increase my chance of death? highest mortality hobbies?",1
"Every day is the same, i’m so lethargic and have zero energy. I have a nice girl, an okay job, lots of friends and play football (soccer) three times a week. 

But I still just want to go to sleep and never wake up.

Every anti-depressant I’ve tried just makes me numb, makes me gain weight or just fucks me up sexually. 

I just had one of them days where I come in from work, have dinner, nap and just lay there trying to think of why i feel like this

I wish i could trade my life for a kids life who’s dying of cancer or some shit 

Man this shit is so tiring",1
"The only person I really liked in my life is leaving.
The only person I ever felt like I'm home.
She's everything I have, literally. 
Everything I do and everything I represent is because of her. 
But I never was good enough. It's my fault. She's leaving because I fuck everything up. I hurt her. 
I don't know anything I could do without her.
It's just over.",1
"She left me because I liked her. We had been in a situationship for a while now and I made the horrible mistake of telling her she meant a lot to me. I told her she helped lift me out of a dark place. She said that that was too much pressure for her and didn't think I could handle/was mature enough for a relationship. Which feels really unfair because before everything I told her I was bipolar and asked if that'd be an issue and she said no. She blamed my ""mood swings"" and how much I cared. Am I really that unlovable? Like seriously what did I do wrong? I feel so used. Empty. She led me on this whole time with no intention of anything serious. 

I really don't wanna live. I thought going to bed and waking up would help but it didn't. This hurts so much. Maybe her feelings are valid because I'm reacting like this. I'm just so distraught. I really didn't think I did anything wrong. I just... I really wanna do it. I feel like a danger to myself because every part of me just wants to end it. This hurts so bad man.",1
"My mother died from cancer back in 2018 when i was 13 yrs old. No one takes me seriously epecially when i say i dont wanna live anymore they tell me to ""knock it off."" And i just want it to end. Kids at school call me weird and when i see them around their other friends they just make fun of me. It seems like weed and other drugs are the only thing keeping me here the only things i have to live for im seventeen now and i cant really see a future for me. I just want it to be over.",1
think i need some therapy,1
"I’m not here to be sad about all the things wrong in my life and how sad and depressed I am. I want to genuinely get better but I can’t find motivation to do anything. Is there anyone who has tips beyond just the average google response like make goals, and all the other things I have a feeling we’ve all read.",1
I’ve always been a guy with pretty tough skin but in mid August I read a visual love novel and I’m extremely attached to a fictional character and the alternative planet he lived in it’s ruining me things were getting better for a while and I was accepting the fact that he was a fictional character but suddenly things have started to go down hill again it’s been three months I don’t know how much longer I can take this I hate the earth.,1
i don’t do anything my depression makes it hard for me to even get up but when i am doing things i’m exhausted 24/7 no matter what. i feel like such a lazy and useless person being 17 and not being able to do anything because of my depression and anxiety,1
"i feel so awful. my mood changes so much everyone and everything affects my mood. my mom gets upset at me for not being positive enough that i will get better, but i've tried. every time j think it's gonna get better it just ends up 10x worse. i want to just get some bars and let the pain melt away but i know i will regret it. i've been feeling like this for almost the whole year, it's gotten worse as the year goes on. i'm so sick of feeling this way. i don't want to die, i just want to feel okay and not feel like it's the end of the world when i'm upset or sad. please if you have any advice tell me please",1
I cant do it on my own. I wish I could be murdered like in my dreams.,1
Over and over again. Now I'm in the middle between rage and surrender,1
"I am really struggling today, it is after 3pm and I’m still in bed and haven’t eaten. Just laying here in the dark 😩 all I want to do is cry",1
"For months I’ve been in this pandemic burnout funk. I work from home exclusively now and I don’t have any clear guidance on when I’m required - or when I’m even allowed - to begin working in the office again. I keep waking up and thinking, “Enough’s enough. Today I’m getting back to normal. I’ll clear my backlog, schedule the meetings I’ve been putting off, finish painting this ugly wall, and get back on track.” But then I don’t… My performance is almost nil and my work attitude has suffered immensely. I feel like there’s no point in continuing a job I used to love aside from slaving aimlessly to support my family…

Day to day, I typically see only three “people”: my wife, my toddler son, and my dog. I don’t get to talk with co-workers, clients, the barista at the coffee shop, etc. anymore. That’s not to say I’m ungrateful for the additional time with my wife and son; quite the contrary, I’m enormously thankful that I’ve been able to spend more time with my son since his birth than my parents ever got with me. But while I’m working and once my son and wife go to bed, I’m alone and miserable. I had been a kind of “rising star” in my organization (not my words, believe that…) but now I have almost no motivation to do anything aside from the bare minimum. 

It sucks. I hate it. I’m miserable. I’m disorganized. I feel trapped. I feel like drugs, books, and video games are my only respite, and even then, they bring no joy, just distraction…",1
"So I don’t have anxiety, just depression. Recently, I don’t know if it’s because of my antidepressants, every time I’m stressed I start shaking so much. I’m worrying about everything so everything of course stresses me. My hobbies are no fun, just something I have to achieve and when I thing about them I tense so much if I don’t cry. 
Any way to get rid of this and enjoy my hobbies or study without breaking down from the stress?",1
"I don’t care about my future. I don’t care about money (I have none). I don’t care about college (I’m failing all my classes). I don’t care about being healthy, I eat one meal a day at 8 pm. I don’t care about being happy because I know that I can’t be because I can’t get out of this situation I’m in and I’m just fucked. I don’t care about working, I’m mentally unable to work right now. I don’t do anything, I have no friends, and no one to talk to about my problems. No one ever contacts me except my parents literally. I probably haven’t received a single text from anyone besides my parents in a year. If I reach out to someone, they usually don’t answer. But if they do, the conversation goes no where and ends in a few minutes. I have nothing in life to look forward to. I spend most of my days doing quite literally nothing, just scrolling on my phone in my bed all day except for Sunday I watch football usually. I ABSOLUTELY REFUSE to take any medicine or go to therapy. Now I’m sure people will say if I want to get better than to do those 2 things, but I don’t really care about getting better and I just won’t do them because I don’t want to. I just can’t see how things can get better. I just know my time is almost up and that I will end up dead soon but I wish that I wouldn’t be sometimes. But unfortunately I don’t have much control over these circumstances or much control over my actions. It feels like someone has a voodoo doll of and making me do things and I’m just sitting back and watching them happen with no control. I don’t think anyone can help me.",1
"Just went out with a girl, and I thought we had everything going. We had the same interests in art, history, video games, even podcasts. I remember we both really liked ds9, and dan carlins hardcore history. At the end we made out, and texted eachother when we got home. Texted her later the following day and the next, no response. Just really blows and wish i could a simple answer sometimes :/.
I don't wanna think about this stuff while im working because it makes me depressed and distracts me which makes me not wanna try and go out and ask girls out. Especially since im already introverted as it is.",1
"From the outside, I have a great job that others would dream of doing. But inside I’m miserable. I can’t connect with my work peers and I feel lonely and unfulfilled. I want to quit this job but my family says it’s a “good opportunity” and “good for my career.” I can’t discern if I’m just depressed or actually miserable because of my work.

I don’t know what will make me happy. Or why it is so hard to be. I try so hard. Soooo hard.",1
"I haven’t had any negative thoughts this month, been a while since i felt good and be at peace with myself.",1
"Recently I have been noticing a reduction in all sensations both positive and negative. These can range from emotional to physical feelings to the point where nothing exhibits the same effects anymore I.E drinking alcohol, smoking weed, sex/masturbation even being sick I don’t feel the same. When I’m drunk I don’t feel as drunk even though I have drank a ton, weed doesn’t make me feel as good as it did before just more tired and my orgasm intensity is greatly reduced. I was wondering if anyone has experienced something similar to this as I am starting to get concerned, I am not on any medications.",1
"I don't want to wake up anymore. I just don't have the energy to continue. I know that my loved ones will be sad, but do I really owe my life to them? Do I really have to go through all this pain? I just want to give up.",1
"Taking antidepressants must be the worst thing ive experienced in my whole life, even worse than the actual depression. I started treatment 3 days ago and im feeling worse than before, im having all kinds of side effects and this was the worst day of my life because i had to go to work like this, i almost had an anxiety attack, i feel numb, i have trouble urinating, im sweating like a pig (which puts me in a horrible mood because i had surgery for hyperhydrosis early this year), i feel like im in a never-ending bad trip, i have blurred vision, i can't coordinate my movements and my brain feels like its going at 1000000000mph. I told my doctor, and he said to reduce the dose but I just want to stop taking them mg pills. I just think I was better before, that all these side effects are not worth it, I cant keep living like this for another couple of weeks, I just cant",1
"I literally take care of myself all the time, I absolutely love fashion and Im sick with it, I consider myself a good person and yet I have bare minimum friends that make fun of me and are idiots",1
Who thinks that depression never heals but that you just learn to live with it?,1
"I just turned 24 last month and I feel so old, it’s actually starting to make me feel depressed and suicidal. I have realized that the best years of my life are over, I’m not as young as I was before and that really scares me and makes me sad. I see all these young teenagers having the time of their lives, being carefree, just having fun with friends and here I am, an adult who just goes to work, come home, and that’s it. I graduated from college last year, and even in college I didn’t have much fun like everyone else was. Now I realize it’s too late and from this point on I am just a working adult, with nothing to look forward to anymore. I wish I could be 16 and carefree again but I know that’s not possible. I just have to accept the fact that my fun, carefree, youthful days are behind me.",1
"I have tried Buspar is the past and it did absolutely nothing for me(can't remember if the doctor prescribed it for anxiety or depression, or my anxiety was from depression lol).

I am not a fan of ""asking for medicine to help"", but when you start to lose happiness is basic things and and start to go down the dark path of nothing bringing you joy...I want to seek medical assistance.",1
i know this is bad but MDMA is my coping mechanism for my depression. i know i have to find different coping mechanisms but it gives me a sense of joy that i haven’t felt in 6 years. i just wanna be okay again.,1
"Earlier this evening I talked with a good friend of mine about my depression, my suicidal thoughts and my time in the psych ward. I don't know why but I felt like he thinks I only want attention. I have no idea how I should describe it to you but ever since I spoke with someone about my mental health for the first time. I always felt like people think that I make up the stuff I tell them. I really don't have the balls to ask them if they really believe me, because then they'll definitely think I only want attention or smth like that. In addition to that my mental state is worse than ever and I really don't know how long I can hold on to this life. I think about suicide on a daily basis right now and everyday I get a step closer to really doing it. I really have no idea how to continue",1
"There’s a guilt for me in saying I’m too depressed when I’m not feeling suicidal nor have any desire for self-harm, but I have to share this with someone, and that first part is a caviar that’s on my heart.

I’m so depressed at this moment that I can’t enjoy the things I usually do. I can’t practice self-restraint. I went to the ATM and took out an overdraft on my account to buy something. I’ve been really trying to stay on top of money, but today I just didn’t care, I was almost glad I was punishing myself emotionally. Spending money on a hobby normally gives me enough of a dopamine hit to get me through to the next thing, but I just felt shitty and guilty and didn’t want to go shopping. God, that’s a sentence…

I came home and did some ice breaking and snow clearing for our house and our neighbours, thinking some manual labour and good deeds might help. That was an hour of work, and I feel worse. I was fighting off tears the whole time. I’m still holding them back as I write this. My wife and kids will be home soon, and I’m dreading the options when they get here. I’m either going to be absent or a complete pill. Either way puts the onus of parenting almost entirely on my wife’s shoulders.

I haven’t been able to afford to see my therapist in 4 months. My antidepressants aren’t equipped to handle this, and with an infant with CHF, I don’t like going to COVID high risk places like doctor’s offices unless it’s life or death, and I’m not there yet.

I don’t like unloading my depression on my family or friends because they carry it around, and want to help. In my experience, my therapist has been the best defence, since I know she’s trained to compartmentalize and let go. She’s the first one out of five I’ve seen that I trust and feel comfortable with. I guess this is just a long winded post to say I miss talking to her. Hopefully I can make it until January when my insurance renews.

Thanks for sticking it through, I hope you’ll be okay and I know you and I aren’t alone. Hold each other up.

"I'm not sure how to elaborate my situation, I 've got friends but when I'm with them i just fake the smiles and no one notice, when i go home i feel like a piece of crap.
I loved someone for 8 years and never got something back, i ruined every possibile relationship because i think that i' m a shitty person and I deserve to be alone.
Every night before going to sleep i put in my hearphones and listen to some ASMR girlfriend shit to try feeling something.
At this point I'm just hoping to die by a disease or a traffic incident, can't make family sad.
Sorry to bother you guys.
Have a good night",1

"i’ve started therapy. i’m trying really hard to catch myself when i start being horrible to myself. i’ve made a self deprecating jar and put money in it anytime i say something like i wanan die or i hate myself or make a joke to put myself down. it’s only been like 2 days and there’s already so much money in it but i’m hoping it will help me to recognize and change my words or thoughts when i’m being unnecessarily hard on myself cos rn it’s like natural to say things really bad to myself. i’m gonna talk abt my day lol. i kept thinking abt last night with SW and like smiling like an idiot. but i need these feelings to pass cos i can’t catch feelings for another lowkey shitty guy. also i’m like 80% my manager treats me differently and is so like mean to me cos she’s racist and idk what to do abt that. she had the audacity to try and stop me from keeping my tip? it’s fucking mine??? i got given it cos i did a good job who r u to take that from me asshole?? hm what else i saw some jewelry that i wanna buy my mum for christmas but it’s so expensive lol i think i’ll buy it on black friday. i had a mini mini panic attack at work today but managed to calm down i felt so faint headed. this week is gonna be so tiring. but i feel a strange mixture of loneliness, emptiness, hope and peace? idk. im incredibly incredibly sad abt the stuff happening to me abt friends leaving me or being shit to me but i have hope that i’m gonna get better. i really want to yk. i feel like i deserve it after all i’ve gone through. i deserve to feel loved and if nobody is gonna do that or show me that they care i have no choice but to show it to myself which is so hard but i think i’m getting better at it. there’s a life that i want to live and it feels just out of reach but if i give up now i’ll never know how close i was to that mindset/life that i want. i am almost 3 months clean from self harm although i still get urges. i got them today but i’m trying not to give in to them. i just feel so invalid when my scars fade but idk i’m working on it. i havnt been journaling or meditating but i think that’s okay. i’m taking small steps and trying to release my emotions and feel the sadness when it comes instead of ignoring it. music helps a lot but i havnt had the energy to listen to anything for a really long time. but i’ve started listening a bit again. taylor’s all too well is genuinely like therapy i think about people who have hurt me when i listen to it.",1
"I’m stuck in this almost “realization” that I am not real, that nothing is. Everything feels so surreal and uneasy. I imagine if I killed my self the world may just “mend” over my life as though I never existed. I would be forgotten and the “lives” I have met would go on not knowing any better. I feel like it would be so easy to swallow some pills or take a few syringes and just, be released. No more pain for me or others. Everything would just become nonexistent, peaceful. 
I feel so detached. I want to think that some would miss me, that life would go on without me, but it feels like there is no “life” at all anyways. Kind of like how it feels when you are dreaming and you know it. You are aware that you are alone, everyone you meet is only in your head, and there is only so much you can do to control the happenings around you. Is it not just the same awake? Why keep trying to fight for something I cannot even grasp.",1
"I almost don't want to go. I got invited by a long time best friend, but haven't seen him in awhile due to COVID. there will be about 5 people I know and 10 I won't (anxiety #1). One of the 5 I know is my ex boyfriend who is close friends with the host (anxiety #2). Also, I have gained 30 pounds since all these people have last seen me and I'm on my journey to body love/acceptance and trying to lose weight blah blah but the fact of the matter is I'm embarrassed by my body and almost don't want to go because of it (#3). I know people will judge me/ notice the weight gain and that makes me uncomfortable. I have a history of eating disorder so i am very preoccupied by body image and it can be on my mind at events like this, making me more self conscious

"Well idk long story short I poured my whole heart, soul, and everything that I am into someone, I made my whole life about them and now they’re gone and I just feel like I’m going insane I probably deserve it I miss the connection we had, it was one sided though she wasn’t happy and never told me, I wish I noticed sooner I don’t have friends or family I can talk to so I’ve just been torturing myself pretending to be okay and act like nothing is wrong but all I wanna do is relapse hard and fall into my old habits.",1
"I overdosed two weeks ago and I still feel like my life is pointless. I don't necessarily want to attempt again but I don't care what happens to me. I was in the hospital for about a week but it didn't help for very long. My mom and sister did not seem very concerned when the police were at my house and when we arrived at the hospital which didn't make me feel cared for at all. When I got home I was officially broken up with and it's only made me go back to the depression that caused me to attempt in the first place. I don't feel like putting in effort into getting better or getting help. Everything I do is only temporary for happiness and as a distraction. I always end up back at square one, thinking about my ex, missing him, wanting to get back together and of course, depressed. I don't know what to do anymore. I might just attempt again and see where that goes. Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated.",1
"I am planning on going to a residential inpatient program at the hospital in December and plan on staying for 5-7 days. This is kind of like a psych ward but definitely more relaxed. They’re more concerned about getting me the help I need rather than addressing safety, so I will able to have my phone and computer. 
I need an excuse to tell my family and friends as to why I’m in the hospital. I am not comfortable sharing that it is about mental health. I am thinking about telling them it is for a medical procedure, but I can’t come up with anything solid. The best thing I’ve thought about is that I need to get some sort of planned surgery or a biopsy or something like that. Something believable but not something too concerning. Any ideas? Anything is appreciated.",1
"Been working on my mental health since I was 9, was prescribed everything in the book and landed on 9mg xanax 50mg adderall. This drug combination is obviously something someone would take if they were trying to get fucked up and if someone were to do this every day it would damage their brain irreparably. it worked and i could function like i did before i started SSRI hell. Was tired of coping that way and I’m currently having my doctor wean me off my medications. i’ve been well aware of the standard winning titration rate ever since I started this shit and it’s all checks out. just started my first month with reduced medication about 2 weeks ago. Obviously as my tolerance went up my use went up and subsequently my suffering was up worse than it’s been, ever. Thinking about going back to out-patient rehab,
before I overdosed because although I was happy to be alive I saw that I was damaging my heart more than anything. I ended up overdosing like 3 times in entirety, yes ER every time. anyway these two weeks have gone by, and I realized that chemicals as my primary coping mechanism was pretty goddamn real… and i’m worried. I immediately Started doing all the things I could be as healthy and active as possible and patient, to cope with the generalized anxiety suicidal ideation mostly.
each day has gotten so much worse, I want to do this but I can only take so much of my own mind screaming at me to kill myself before I know I need to get myself checked in at the psych ward. Did it twice before when the ideation got out of hand. don’t want to go through that again but I will if it keeps me alive, however you can see that this is a thin line to ride I don’t want to have to take the gamble. My diagnoses don’t matter but I do experience really extreme physical pain and fatigue that comes secondary to my depression and anxiety NOS.
when there’s no anxiety no depression. there’s no pain or fatigue. I really wanna get through this, Type me a whole goddamn 30 paragraph essay and I swear to God I’ll read it, a single word of advice i’ll pay just as much attention to. anybody please?",1

I feel like im spiraling out of control. I know These mini drepressions do end in a week or less but they always leave havoc behind. I wish i wasnt this cyclical up and down constantly.",1
"I made efforts to develop new habits and it wasn't enough to hack it. I'm so angry and sad, same time every single year. Why does a part of me literally die every November?",1
"For background, I'm 20, grew up in a broken home until about age 15 when my single mother somewhat got her shit together, and I left college because I didn't know what I wanted to do, but am now back for computer science.

A club of people I'm in, one of them have already learned html, and a lot of them are already taking more advanced classes while I'm struggling to get through trig.

I feel like I'm so behind them and therefore don't belong with them, despite me having started the group way back during my first bout in college.

I have been developing a pretty severe depression and I feel like a nuisance every time I think of talking to others. This feeling of behindness or a relative idiocy compared to them just increases this. I was too busy distracting myself from a broken and messed up home to worry about ccp classes and here they are, wirh like a semesters worth of ccp out of the way and I can't help but feel like it's hopeless to try to fit in or compare with them.

How do I get around this?",1
"Hey Guys! ivve been going through a tough time for almost a year now. It keeps getting worst. I came across hypnotherapy, and was curious about it. 

Any thoughts? opinions? has anyone tried it?

Please feel free to drop any coping mechanisms tips and suggestions unrelated to hypnotherapy. It would be much appreciate it :)

thanks",1
"I in no way want to trivialise the mental anguish of depression, I haven't been formally diagnosed , but a GP once said I have symptoms and I should come back for a referral, I never went back. today was a particular difficult day I haven't left the house I haven't even washed or brushed my teeth. I don't feel sad I feel numb and completely demotivated from doing anything I have been in bed for hours not wanting to move. Not all days are like this thankfully. I am quite hungry but I can't be bothered to do anything about it. Am I just lazy and horrible?",1
"I'm literally afraid to be alone, when I'm alone all I think about is ending my life. I look at the gun in the closet, I think about running the car in the garage, I look up how to tie a hangman's noose. I don't get it, I have a good life. I Have a wife who loves me, a daughter I adore and a career that I dreamed of. It's like there's something broken in my head, I want to end my life so badly. The only thing keeping me here is my father committed suicide when I was young and I saw the way it tore apart my family, I can't do that to my to my wife or my daughter or my mother or my siblings. It's like I'm just going through the motions for everyone else. I feel so weak for thinking this way and I'm terrified to tell my family that I'm broken...",1
"See, my therapist is always talking my shit down or not taking me serious.
 As an example (can be skipped) :
Me: I'd like to get tested for ADHD
Her: Why tho? Like what benefits would you have?
Me: like is be diagnosed and not feel like I'm faking it
Her: why do you think I think you are faking it?
Me: I could search for solutions for my problems better
Her: so you wanna use it as an excuse + you can fake a diagnosis too
Me: *starts crying *

She also did that when I told her I was mad at my dad. She was like ""it's because you have the same traits. You just don't like yourself"". No sis, I am mad cause he threw a f-ing spoon at me while I was sobbing and begged him to stop screaming (that was when I was 12 and it caused trauma).

I also don't appreciate her company, it makes me uncomfortable. I am at a clinic so they have multiple therapist there, but I'm pretty scared to call and ask if I can change. Any advice?",1
"Super simple. My brain can’t feel the chemical rush or that hormonal rush in the brain. I still get horny and feel some emotions in my
Body I can still laugh and cry. But I can’t feel anything when it goes to the brain does it even make sense? And stress also",1
"I started feeling empty at age 12/13. Half of my life I have spent feeling this way. I go in circles and come back to feelings of life being meaningless and being an inadequate person.

University did not help. I nearly dropped out multiple times. I thought everything would get better if/when I finished. I managed to achieve a really good grade. The best way I can describe my feelings when I graduated was like holding a long breath. I felt the same way.

Now this feeling manifests in my job. I worked at a call centre for a while, which actually helped my confidence a lot. I work in administration now, and it’s boring but still better. But I hate feeling like the amount I suffered at university was for nothing.

I met the love of my life at university. I’m terrified that me being miserable will eventually push them away. They’re the best thing that happened to me.",1
I actually had a pretty good day for once but then I got home and started crying I'm scared to get better I'm scared I'm going to ruin everything and I'm just terrified to get better it scares me I'm not sure why.,1
"I used to always doubt and think about everything . When I started doubting rational thinking and logic's validity I felt like going crazy and I had panic attacks about it . And now I feel like i'm denying my mind and thoughts and I don't trust my opinions and beliefs and I doubt all my thoughts . It is soo hard . Also I know that there is no bad and good so I started thinking about crimes and I started asking myself why should I be a thinker and a philosopher while others are criminals ? Even tho i'm against violence and criminality but I keep denying my beliefs and keep asking myself , who said that i'am right ? And do I think i'am better than others and why should I even be better ? I started only thinking about suicide and I just wanna end this hell i'am living in . I started having headaches all the time because of these irrational thoughts and i'm feeling lost and I don't recognize myself anymore and I started denying my rationality and existence and I don't wanna decide or think about anything anymore I just wanna disappear .
I was already struggling with anxiety depression and ocd and still .",1
"I hope I can describe my feelings correctly. I know it sounds stupid, but I would like to be an immortal and all-knowing person. I would like to be an organism that can see all dimensions, eg. time. I hate knowing that my decisions are not made rationally but are influenced by emotions. I have life energy, but it is lost day by day because I have no purpose. Why do people get up every day? To get a good job? To earn money? To live well? But what am I supposed to live well for? Rationally, I don't see any meaning in life, and that's why I have no motivation to make an effort. 

Does anyone have answers to my questions?",1
"It's one of the worst feelings in the world when you know you are broken beyond repair and you have tried everything to get better and I mean everything. But you keep on going mostly because of friends or family and everyday is a constant struggle to stay alive dealing with this shit for decades. It wears you down day after day it feels like it's a never ending nightmare people say ""life is to short"" I say it's not when you are suffering for years. The only way out is death eventually I wish I could go back and change things but the damage is done unfortunately and now I'm rotting away dreaming of a escape plan on the perfect day to break free from this failed life.",1
"Have you ever felt save around someone like you could tell this person everything? Well I did this a while ago and after I told a bit about myself and my interest the guy was just disgusted of me. This is not the first time that happened to me. I feel like I can't talk to anyone about anything. As soon as I start speaking people look at me with very judging eyes like they think ""What the hell is this idiots problem?""",1
"Does anyone else’s mood fluctuate too much that they feel they can’t work? I’m in customer service. I work from home and I dread going everyday because I don’t have the energy to talk to people and pretend to be happy enough to speak. Right now, I’m working and I almost want to quit because of how bad I feel. I know nothing is wrong but I literally feel like a cloud is over my head and I just rather be lying down. I feel like crying and idk why. My body just feels so heavy. I hate when I get like this. I still have 2 hours and a half to go.",1
Im not sure how much more i can take.,1
"As far as I can remember, my whole life has been a lot of up and downs. I'm always chasing the next goal. My dad was a business man who valued money &amp; providing for the family over everything, he never showed his human side until his last days when he was very sick &amp; dying. He was always busy, I didn't see him much, he didn't go to too many funerals, weddings &amp; holidays. The man was always busy. 

He instilled his mindset of working hard everyday and just valuing money and success over everything. He pushed me to study hard and be the best I can be. 

I'm 26, I went to university, I got my degree, I've a good job. I'm a workaholic, I'm always trying to be the best, I've a good salary, In a year or so I'll be in the 1% top earners in my country (South Africa), but somehow I just can't seem to sit down and relax. I'm always thinking and stressing about how I can make it to the next level.

I've been diagnosed with depression and I was on anti depressants for a while. 

How do I relax and just enjoy the moment? How do I stop over thinking about the future. 

Thanks for reading 🤲🏼🤲🏼🤲🏼",1
It just feels good to say im not actually gonna do it lol,1
"I was reading how anirecetam, macuna pruriens, rhodora rosea, etc can be alternatives to antidepressant medication. Can these work just as well or should I look into getting on an antidepressant at least for now while I try working on the root causes? (Maybe gut related, thyroid, leaky gut etc)",1
"I’m just sick of being depressed. It’s probably been multiple years now, and I still take hours to get out of bed. I have no energy to wash my hair or even shower everyday anymore, and whenever I do I sit down and cry whilst I’m in there. I’m not even sad about anything, my life is doing better now that I’m out of my ex-toxic relationship. I used to make YouTube videos but I ran out of motivation and then stopped, which only made life worse as I now have no income as YouTube was my primary income. I’m seriously just stuck on what to do. The other day I put on some mascara and was incredibly proud of myself as if that’s impressive at all. Any advice would be amazing please and thank you. &lt;3",1
"question for people who started taking medication for depression (or anxiety), when did you first feel a difference and what was it like? did it help or make things worse?",1
"I am so used to being disappointed that now whenever goes something wrong, I am always like I was expecting that already. Today my heart broke, the final thing was alive, and now I feel numb. To the pain. To the sorrow. I feel the knife but it isn’t able to penetrate, you feel me? I have gone through bad depression but is being indifferent to everything is also depression? I don’t want prayers or wishes. Nothing. I don’t want advices. I am not in the mood for that now. Thanks! Don’t mean to be rude at all by last line.",1
"I have ocd which is a huge influence on anxiety and depression. I have fluctuations of anxiety and depression and lately mine has swung low over actions that I took that could have gone terribly wrong, even though they didn’t.",1
"I just feel like everyone else is able to make these awesome connections and im over here unable to talk to anyone. I feel like such a waste, and that no one will care about me once im gone",1
I can't though. I feel like an ugly witch most of the time and my depression is holding me back from reaching my goals. Such a waste! I'm very much hoping it will get better.,1
"I used to be extrenely sensitive and caring and empathetic. I used to cry for myself and others all the time. Now thats a rare occurence. I also hear sob stories that people tell me but I cant truly feel for them like before. Its more like logical than feelings. Like i logically know thats bad and im sorry. Not I feel it in my heart thats so terrible im sorry. I dont cry for others. Like some friends will cry together over something that happened but I barely react. My friends bracelet that her late grandma gave her broke and she was about to cry and I felt nothing deeply. It was more of oh thats bad i hope she doesnt cry. While the other friend told her it was ok to cry and let it out. When someone tells me they miss me, I never miss them in the same way. I dont teuly want to see or talk to them. But I justs ay it back. However, when it concerns me and something happens to me I get very upset. But not as much for others. I was just stiffly there. Is this a form of apathy or not?",1
"To cope with my depression in social situations, I sometimes make jokes about myself, which almost always get laughs from whomever I’m talking to. 

I guess the jokes are funny because they’re true. Making them laugh feels good in the moment, I pay for it in the long run tho.",1
"According to the therapist and doctor, I have been in a moderately severe depression for 15+ years. I have moments where tears well up and I get a lump in my throat without a conscious trigger along with extreme episodes of apathy. 

My kids are my ""why"" to not just give up and melt into the ground. They're 3, 6, 15 and 17. I don't do much for them now, nor do I care to for some reason. The 2 older ones have expressed that they wouldn't be bothered if I was no longer around and my 6 year old daughter has flat out said she would be okay if I wasn't around, that she could get ""a new daddy"", but got visibly upset when she was asked if she felt the same about her mom (her mom thought these were funny things to bring up/ask my 6 year old, meanwhile I'm outraged every time I think about it because of the severe psychological damage this can cause my 6 yo and has already caused me.) My 3 year old is attached to me, for now, but I am struggling to even care to pay the bills anymore and it only seems to be getting worse day-by-day. I don't want to go to work 99% of the time and don't care to find anything better. 

I started medication and that seemed to be helping, but when my S.O. of 10 years found out that I was on it, she said I needed to stop the medication and start on other regiments to help with depression because I don't take medication (even for headaches) unless I feel I really have to and she felt I ""didn't really have to"". She said she thought I was ""stronger than that"" which I felt was an attack on my character, though I don't believe she meant it that way.. those comments, followed by a loss of health insurance and lack of money caused me to quit both of my medications cold-turkey. That's exasperated things and has made me more reclusive and irritable lately.

I have no true friends, so the other day, when a neighbor/former co-worker of mine reached out to me asking if I could help him swap an engine, I was excited that I had an opportunity to make a real friend. 

I told my S.O. about the request and she asked me why I'm ready to help when he snaps his fingers when he hasn't done anything for me. I explained that he has offered help, in the past, though minimal, and I was excited to do an engine swap for the first time. She was annoyed and started listing off everything she wanted me to get done before I left to help him, including things that I had either already handled or normally don't handle. I perceived this as her way of trying to prevent me from helping him and told her, ""if you don't want me to go over there, just say so."" 

Long-story short, she said maybe I'm depressed because of her and that maybe we should ""take a break"". I disagreed and she stopped talking to me and stopped being around me as of 4 days ago. She is sleeping in different parts of the house, using the kids to communicate minimal information, covering up/turning my indoor security camera so I can't see what's going on when I'm not there and even staying quiet about how my dogs escaped from her leaving the gate open, her taking 2 dogs to the vet in an emergency over chocolate and saying nothing when she takes my 3 year old to the doctor over a fever he developed while I was at work yesterday.

I don't want medication now, I can't seem to get myself to break my habits for one reason or another, and I don't have the funds/ability to seek further professional help. I don't know what to do or where this will take me now. I don't see my purpose any longer. Maybe ""a new daddy"" would be what's best for them.",1
"I don't even need to be happy, I just want to be normal so I don't have to deal with depression and suicidal thoughts 24/7.",1
"I'm not doing fine. I'm actually doing quite poor. I've gotten really good at putting on a good show for my family, and the ones around me. I even have regular activities that I like doing, like bowling league. But when I am left alone with my thoughts, I often have to fight from letting my sadness and anxiety overwhelm me. It used to be I was happy with times of sadness, now I'm sad with times of happiness.

I feel hollow and empty a lot. I don't know what to do with myself, like I don't really care about anything anymore. Sure I like doing my hobbies, especially riding my bike, but they are just distractions. I always return to my base state of loneliness.

I don't know why I feel so lonely. Like I said I made some new friends recently. Started doing DnD, and actually have fun with that. But I'm going to be 25 soon, and I don't have ANYONE I would consider my best friend. I don't have friends with memories that go way back, or people that know me better than myself. For some reason, I have always measured my friends by thinking ""If I got married tomorrow, who would be in my wedding? Who would be my best man?"" The answer has always generated a very sad and lonely wedding. At most I have had 2 people that I think would be good groomsmen, but they both left. And I've NEVER had someone I was convinced would chose me as their best man. I know it's likely an irrational thought to have, but something about that thought just cripples me inside. And I can't ever shake it.

I guess I shouldn't be surprised. Once I became aware of my feelings of loneliness, a look back on my life revealed that I have always been like that. Always the odd man out, the guy you would talk to in class but never invited to any events outside of school. Even when I did make true friends, it wouldn't work out. Several times I voluntarily made decisions that ended a friendship with someone who actually cared about me. So I guess I shouldn't be surprised that it happened with the best thing that ever happened to me.

She was my person. My best friend. The person that I wanted to spend every single day with. Now she's gone. And I think the worst part is not knowing why she left. She never gave me an actual answer, even though I tried digging for one several times. So I am left with a brain that tries desperately to come up with all the possible explanations. Maybe she never really loved me, maybe she found someone else, maybe I wasn't satisfying her needs, maybe she didn't like the person I turned into, maybe she never really forgave me for lying to her about smoking weed all the time, or for taking this job, maybe she just realized she didn't want to spend her life with me. There are so many possible reasons. I come up with a new one every day. And it's REALLY easy to look past the explanations that hurt the least (for example, maybe she just left because she needs to work on herself). But my brain never looks past one that puts it all on my shoulders. So what I end up doing is carrying the weight of all those possibilities. In my mind, it's like she DID break up with me for every horrible reason that I can imagine, and I can't convince myself otherwise.

I'm not sure why I can't let this go, but it feels like it's because I'm not ready to let go. Because letting go means letting go of her. It means accepting the idea that I will likely never be with her again. I will never get to love her, or be loved by her, in the same way ever again. I was so lucky to have her, and I feel like I knew it. And I did try to be the person she wanted. She asked me to take better care of myself, eat right, and all that good stuff. And I did. I thought I was really becoming the man she deserved, and found myself *wanting* to be that better man. But I didn't do enough. I couldn't hold on to what I still consider the love of my life, and the only person I have ever felt might actually be my soulmate; and I have to live with that for the rest of my life.

I doubt many people will bother to read this, if any at all. Don't really know why I felt the need to post this in the first place. I'm likely just being very dramatic. But I guess on some level it feels good to vent, since I don't have anyone else I feel comfortable talking to about it (even my therapist lmao). I don't have any intention of harming myself or others, honestly. So I don't want anyone to worry about me. Like I said, just felt good to have a place where I can put my feelings to words.

To the people who made it this far, if you have someone special in your life, give them a hug for me. I may never get the chance to hold the person that means the most to me again, and I don't wish that feeling on anyone. I love you all.

&amp;#x200B;

A broken kid",1
"Someone help me please

Ive had this fear for so long now that I would be better off gone and on top of that so many things have been added to my plate. My whole life i grew up with little to no family being a product of an adopted family and the ones that are around would always choose over me and throw me on back burners so I went to find love. Being a bisexual male i wasn’t accepted fully so I went on my own journey to find love and got married to someone who I thought would treasure me. In the course of things I’ve been mistreated not accepted by his family or anyone even while being married. Fast forward of me trying to come to terms with it he gets drunk and ends up going behind me back and pretty much cheating on me and lying consistently to me while forcing me to stay under his control. I don’t know what to do, I sit inside all day with the constant thought of doing stupid things to myself. Im injured unable to walk my social skills suck and no one even gives me the time of day to be my friend even if i was allowed to have friends in my relationship. Im so sick and tired of waking up everyday wishing I wasn’t here or had someone to care about me. Now im stuck in an apartment with someone that promised to make my life better and care for me that wont even allow me to leave him and I hate myself for it. More than anything this feels like an infinite loop of everything my life was meant to be but not having anyone to get through it doesn’t make it any better. Ive been on numerous apps trying to make friends for two years and nothing. What should I do? I have no options nowhere to call my home and no shoulder to lean on and im afraid if nothing happens soon it’ll just result in the worst possible scenario. Im tired of being abused, im tired of people rejecting me and ridiculing me, I just want someone to love and care for me not even just in a relationship",1
"Hey umm, I'm just curious if this only happens to me but, is it normal to not really know what I enjoy or dislike anymore? I do have cravings to do specific things sometimes but when i try to think in detail ""what do I like"" I usually can't find an answer. (It feels like I lost my personality in a way)

Any replies is appreciated, I'm not really sure what to do with this situation honestly",1
"The bag is full. Full of things that cause pain and discomfort. Broken glass. Needles. Ants. Spiders. Extreme Heat. At the bottom lies a ticket. Marked ______. Some will dump the bag and grab the ticket. Some will cut out the bottom and retrieve it effortlessly. Others will stick their hand in and come out swiftly with minimal damage.
For you it will not be so easy. You will dig around. It will be very painful and take a long time. With every second, your head will fill with doubt. Is there even anything in here? Should I give up? Is this even worth it? These are questions that only you can answer. For now you dig. and dig. You may grab it and it slips away. You might lose all hope. But you dig. You will find the ticket and by that time you might look around and realize years have passed. The people who are surrounding you have changed and you have as well. You stand victorious with a mangled arm holding that ticket. Knowing the pain will disappear and the wounds will heal. You smile, because you kept digging.
I’ve never written anything before but wrote this when I woke up. Idk maybe it can help someone out.",1
"I have some very good days, and I have some awful days where it feels as if every single thing is so hard to get started on, or to just do. These days have me counting down every single minute towards whatever task I have to do that day. Looking back, I feel this has been happening for a while, but has especially flared up lately. 

I work as a personal trainer, am in school for electrical engineering, I work out 4-5 days a week, and am in good shape, and have fun hobbies like playing guitar and playing video games, and have a great girlfriend. Sounds like a setup for a good life right? 

 It hasn’t felt like it. Where I think my depression has stemmed from is, well a lot of things. My home life is pretty rough as my brother is autistic and causes a lot of issues, especially with my mom and step dad. He constantly fights and bickers with my mom about even the simplest things, so at least 4 days out of the week, if I’m home trying to watch tv, I have a background track of pure anger and yelling downstairs. I cant describe how bad and how long these arguments can last sometimes. It can be upwards of 3 hours, and sometimes resumes later at night, and usually involves someone breaking things or screaming. This of course disturbs my peace, and especially my studying. This is actually happening as I type this. The solution should be to just leave my house, but you can only be away from home for so long. There is a constant tension and negative mood at my house. At this point I just hide in my room to try and get through it. My mom also never really cares about what I’m up to, or how I am as the issues with my brother gets most of her attention. On top of this, I have been dealing w some relationship issues to due to my girlfriend having some medical issues that have stopped us from having sex for the last 2 years. We’re working on it, but it’s definitely apart of my depression. Also i don’t feel like I have the best friends. We’ve been friends since we were kids and we all make fun of eachother but sometimes they’re bigger assholes than the norm and I take what they say seriously and react badly at times. I do have this constant feeling that they don’t see me as a real friend, but they ask me to hangout every weekend so they must enjoy my company right? I’ll even go to the gym with them at least once a week but I still question our friendship. This issue might be from my already persisting depression but I don’t know. 

Overall I can’t figure out if this is good cause for depression. I think I have a type called Dysthymia as I can’t even enjoy things like guitar some days, even though I adore music and it’s always been my outlet. I sit here with unfinished homework, not having gone to the gym today, not having played guitar, dreading having to act happy and witty to my clients I have at work in an hour. My next step is to see a therapist but I don’t know if this could necessarily solve my issues. 

If anyone can relate or has anything to say on the subject I’d greatly appreciate it.",1
"I recently broke up with my ex and when I left her she threatened to say stuff about me to other people. 
Fast forward I started talking to this girl in my class but today I found out my ex has been saying stuff to this girl. about how apparently I’m obsessed with this girl and that I’ve been telling people I’m already going out with her. It’s made things horrible and I don’t know how to talk to the girl to explain that what she has been told are lies. I don’t know what i should do. I don’t know if it’s better to ask to talk to her to tell her what she’s been told isn’t true or if I should just forget about everything and not even bother trying to explain myself.",1
"For the last 6 and a half years me and my mother have both been struggling with some serious immune problems that as of now have yet to have any conclusive diagnosis and coupling that with my ADHD, OCD, my anxiety, depression and Aspergers it is practically a miracle I am still alive. I am a jr. in high school I keep finding myself stuck in a cycle of things going ok enough for me to function at a limited capacity and then like the flip of a switch things just start crashing down. All the while my peers are seemingly thriving, I used to have hobbies but they aren’t even something that I can begin to pick back up and whenever I try to pick my hobbies back up self loathing and all the wonderful emotions associated ensue with full force. I have never made any serious attempts on my life. However I have found myself on multiple occasions on the fourth story balcony of my house only to have my fears to stop me. My failure to even have enough courage to end it,only deepens my self loathing. I don’t know what to do anymore. I have more than enough to keep me happy and then occupied but it just doesn’t.

"Depression has been getting worse as time goes on.

I've tried 4 antidepressants, 2 atypicals. All failures.

I like my therapist. It's a good conversation. But at about 15-16 sessions in and I'm not really doing any better. Arguably I'm doing worse. 

I've spoken to multiple doctors. Two different psychiatrists this year.

Nothing. Literally, nothing helps. I'm very unhappy. Every attempt I try to get better I end up the same or worse.

The thing is I only go to shower once I start to smell :/ I honestly hate the idea of eating and no matter how much my stomach growls, I can't bring myself to stand up and get food. If it was not for my mom I would probably be eating once per day. My life is over. My final exams conducted on a national level are in less than a month and I haven't even studied a single chapter of any subject. I can't bring myself to. My practical and viva of maths and chemistry is in 8 hours and I have zero prep.
At this point I don't even wanna live anymore. No, I'm not suicidal (atleast not yet, idk how). I just want to stop *existing* if it makes any sense. I can't even bring myself to play my favourite game anymore which kept me happy. I have lost Interest in *EVERYTHING*. I'm just pulling a all-nighter at this point to that I don't make a fool out of myself 8 hrs later. Idk what's wrong with me. My mind feels like a different entity and is telling me to stop acting lazy and seeking attention.
I have tried venting to my 2 best friends. But the best they can do is assure me, give me sympathy and tell me it would be better and to keep pushing. Idk how long will I be able to push. I have even lost the ability to physically cry.
Can someone please tell why I'm like this? I miss the old me who used to do everything with ease and had energy and spirit :(",1
"I can suffer from what I would call extreme swings in my depression. I have had clinical depression for almost 2/3 of my life and for the most part, have managed to overcome day-to-day struggle and be content. However, from time to time I will experience what I would term as an extreme swing in my mood where I go from content to very depressed where I often wish that I could die already. I would say I occasionally have thoughts of killing myself but I have dealt with those most of my life. The thing is I often rely on my friends when I get down like this and just tell them exactly how I feel. Being that I am extremely sad, don't really have the will to live, deny that things will get better etc.. I do not want to put this pressure on them as I feel it strains the few relationships I have and I don't want to ruin them. &amp;#x200B;
I know for the most part what triggers these feelings but I am not sure how to prevent them from being triggered. Most of the time it's caused by people not wanting to be my friend anymore or getting rejected by the person I currently like. These feelings can often be exaggerated from my anxiety and can sometimes cause it to spiral. I was wondering how most of you cope in situations like this? I don't necessarily want to isolate myself when this occurs but at the same time, I don't want to strain any relationships.",1
"I can’t even watch TV, a movie, read, or play a game.

I came back to reddit this week, but truly nothing is giving me pleasure. I don’t even want to scroll on social media. I have no interest but existing on my couch or bed. I’m hoping this time will end soon.",1

I dearly loved someone, she was an amazing friend, she is also gone now. How can I he one those cool guys, how can i be an attractive person while I am ugly as fuck.

"Incoherent rant. Ignore me, if you want.

I can’t relax around her or be “platonic” without craving something more. But she really wants to hang out, and we’ve already made plans. I couldn't say no.

Why would she want to hang out with someone that clearly loves her? Even though we are technically still ""friends"" .. if you’ve seen my post history, you’ll know about how this situation has been going on for months. And you'll know how much of an emotional toll this has taken on me.

Right now, she thinks that I'm completely fine with being rejected. I came across like it was no big deal, and that her honesty was sincerely appreciated (pretty standard way to accept rejection, in my opinion). Although I may still have my dignity, she believes that I am now completely over her. Fucking.. great. So now, what if she has met someone, and that is why she wants to “catch up”? I don’t think I could handle that. Like, I would literally want to punch the girl or guy that she's with. I'd have to leave the room. My emotions would run ragged and I'd struggle to keep myself afloat, emotionally.

My heart feels like it is breaking. And yet, I don't know why.. ? I don't know why the initial rejection, and her determination to keep in touch with me, hurts so much.

I still love her.. but she doesn’t love me in the same way. Boundaries (i.e., no cuddling, holding hands.. stuff that we used to do before I had confessed my feelings) have been established.. this breaks my heart. We were so close before. I am a good person. Honest, I am. I have so much love to give.. and yet, that was not enough. I wish I could be enough. I feel so worthless. Physically sick at the thought of seeing her, and then not seeing her. Either way, I end up completely humiliated and full of hurt.

I don't think I will be able to face her. I still value her company, though. She doesn't love me either way, so fuck it. She can live her life. I can live mine. Fuck women, man.

I don't need anyone.",1
"Dr. Jane Doe,

I am reaching out because of how utterly astounded I am at the difference between tablets and capsules as it comes to Prozac. Immediately upon switching and increasingly thereafter I am having a hard time not thinking it undeniable that there is something different between the two. Hyperbole is no help, but this difference compares to being on a medicine and not being on one. The fact that I noticed change suddenly is unbelievable to me, and I don’t attribute it to the addition of Bupropion as these feelings are not new, but because I experienced them verbatim the last time I took 60mg tablets. 

I have no request here only testimony. On capsules the day was overcast but the rain stopped, on tablets the sun is out. May this be a testimony to you for any other patient who is confounded by a seemingly irrational difference. I don’t deny the nuance of such an idiosyncratic experience.

The Bupropion is working just fine. I question it’s need after the Prozac experience. But overall I would like to stick with it as perhaps as it settles things improve even more. 

Happy Holidays!",1
I am trying so hard to make things better. Every failing even the smallest one feels like if someone punched me into stomach. It hurt so much this desperation. I'm constantly sabotaging myself becouse that's the way i learned to live and i don't know how to break those patterns.

"This is kinda a rant post(also on mobile so sorry for formatting issues)

I’m a 19 year old AFAB(non-binary), and I feel trapped. 

Over seven months ago, I moved out of my abusive household into my bfs house. My situation was abusive, and I reached a breaking point. I left, and my parents disowned me. 

I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety since I was 10, and later down the line I realized that I have bad dissociation problems, and potentially(trying to see someone who can evaluate me for these) an ED, PSTD, Austin, and DID. My mental health is fucked up, and my body is also(less so, but still bad).

I’m currently seeing a therapist, but this therapist was recommended(lowkey kinda forced to go to her) by my grandparents. She’s a Christian therapist who isn’t an ally, and as a member for the LGBTQ community this isn’t… good for me. 

The only person who I can actually trust besides my bf is my aunt. She has gone through basically the same thing as me and has been incredibly kind and supportive. She even said that if I absolutely needed to, I could move in with her and her girlfriend.

I feel trapped by my own mental health, and I’m honestly too tired to keep fighting. My body hurts, and my mind is in pieces. 

My parents hate me(feeling is mutual), my grandparents are unsure how to help me, and my aunts live states away. My bf doesn’t know how to help, and I feel bad not spending time with him due to sleeping more often than not.

I feel alone. I just wish that I could have a friend who genuinely understands the shitty nature of this. I’m broken, and I don’t think I can’t ever get better.

⚠️ Warning ⚠️ TW Trigger Warning
In this post I talk about sensitive mental issues that can be strong for people with mental disorders. I make this statement before continuing.

I have wanted to tell my story for a long time, not because I want people to know my life, but because I know, like me, there are people who need help.

I was undecided whether to do it in a video or in writing. Anyone who knows me knows that I love cameras but I also love writing. If I did it in a video maybe more people would see it but I was not going to be able to avoid the urge to cry by telling my story.

So here we go.

Warning: ⚠️ TW Trigger Warning

I was always a very active person since I was little, with a privileged mind and thoughts. Hyperactive and always with a head full of ideas. A leading person known for “getting involved in what an invention existed”. Aside from this, I was a rebellious, authority-defying and impulsive teenager (I still am and will be). My mind was always racing very fast. It did not stop. We found it normal. In spite of all this, in the 90's, the fact of diagnosing mental disorders in adolescents, and adults as well, did not yet exist as such. This is another topic to talk about it at another time.

In short, my life since I can remember it was ""different"" from others. I felt different. But I didn't care. And so the years went by until in 2015, if I remember correctly, I fell into a spiral that did not seem to end.

I had the best jobs. In my field of Public Communication. My execution was excellent and I was always recognized for inventing “things” that “no one would think of”. But, at the same time, when I did not like something or they put obstacles in my way to do things ""the way I wanted"", I would end up impulsively quitting. It wasn't until my last job; where I met an extraordinary person who to this day is still my best friend; that I realized, with her help, that something was wrong.

Let's stop to explain something. Let's start with the point that most (or not most, but the trend is much higher) of people with mental disorders may abuse legal and illegal drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes. I can say that I used and do use cigarettes; I drank alcohol socially for a long time; medicinal cannabis since adolescence, when adolescence was still not medicinally legal; and I had the worst vice of all: opioids.

I have CKD, Chronic Kidney Disease, stage two. In the early 2000's I got seriously ill with my kidneys. To make a long story short, after surgeries, tests and everything, I was prescribed Percocet, Tramadol, and Oxycodone. It did not take a week to “love” these medications. Sure, I didn't know about the dangers of opioids at the time. I just thought it was ""fine"" because the doctor prescribed them for me.

So, after this short explanation, my life started to be an inner hell. I couldn't work without having an energy drink for breakfast. To which I added cigarettes, marijuana, Tramadol, Percocet and coffee. It seemed that everything made sense to me and I could work ""better"" with these substances in my body. What I did not accept; and I say accepted because everyone who knows me knows that I love Medicine and that I seem to have a degree that I always dreamed of but I did not study and I continue to regret it; it was wrong. I couldn't understand why I had to do that to my body in order for my ""mind"" to believe that everything was ""fine.""

I started to get sick. I lost an unbelievably amount of weight. At a point that I didn't look healthy, I looked sick. I didn't eat, I just drank water, coffee, and energy drinks. From just thinking about having to go to work and deal with people, I would start vomiting uncontrollably. I could not understand how a person like me, who always liked the public and who loved ""being the center of attention"", could now be afraid of social interaction, even more so in a job that he loved.

This story is long, but to sum it up, I had several hospitalizations. All admissions were for the same diagnoses: anorexia nervosa and gastritis nervosa. I kept leaving the hospital without knowing what was wrong with me. I understood less and less why I was throwing up so much. I got to vomit 20 to 30 times a day. Sure, the bile, because I didn't eat. I lost the gagging reflex because my body was used to vomiting. If there was a problem at work, I solved it as usual but I did not feel like myself, I did not feel well and inwardly screamed for help. They began to give me memos for getting sick, to lower my hours, in short, to treat me badly to push me to leave. One day, I got tired. I remember that same day; before running to the bathroom with the phone, a former co-worker told me: “You are to be admired. I couldn't do everything you do.” That comment struck a chord with me. I called my husband, may he rest in peace, and I told him that I had to resign, that I couldn't take it anymore. He told me to do it, that my health came first and that he supported me.

I quit. Part of me was relieved, but another part, my mind, was the same or worse. There was really something going on with me. The racing thoughts did not stop. Concerns for the future did not go away. My mind wouldn't stop thinking for a minute. I always wanted to have everything perfect. I wanted to be the perfect wife and mother. I wanted to be so perfect that I hated myself if I made a ""mistake."" But sometimes those ""mistakes"" were made unconsciously.

I started giving more time to my social networks and to my work as a beauty and makeup influencer. Behind the screen everything was beautiful. My social networks were pure positivity and happiness. It was not true. I was always screaming inside. With three children, a husband, pets, self-employment, and much more; my ""stress"" did not subside. It was getting bigger and bigger.

I started to stop doing the things that I liked. I closed my social networks on impulse and lost money, time and hard work. All the time I felt that on each side I looked there was a huge log that would not allow me to keep up. I ""turned around"" and ""went on."" Clearly, it wasn't right.

One day, I decided to tell my doctor of more than 20 years, that, by the way, he is an excellent human being. Sadly he told me that he needed help. He handed me a business card so that I could call a colleague, a psychologist, and attend to me with her. After he called her, I called and made an appointment with her. Meanwhile, my doctor prescribed Clonazepam 2mg for anxiety twice a day.

Clonazepam suited me right from the start. I thought it was what I needed. My first appointment with the psychologist came. The first diagnoses: Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Severe Recurrent Major Depression. The panic attacks weren't getting better. I was just sleepy all day but the anxiety and depression were not improving.

A battery of psychologists and psychiatrists followed my case. Second round of added diagnoses: Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Panic Disorder, Anorexia Nervosa and ADHD or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.

My husband became ill in 2018. I abandoned my psychotherapy treatment and dedicated myself to taking care of him. A year later he died. At first, I ""knew how to handle"" the situation of being a widow with three children. In the morning my coffee or my energy drink and my opioids. And at night my medications for anxiety. I honestly don't remember very well that dark period where I was in a bottomless pit and unable to get out of there.

At the beginning in my widowhood, the first months were of ""trying to be strong for my children."" One day that I don't remember, I fell into bed and didn't get up from there. I was not interested in anything. Neither eat, nor bathe, nor go out. The bills were piling up, my children worried not knowing what to do. And I curled up in my bed. At that point, I decided to quit opioids. On my own, by myself. If they were going to give me withdrawal effects I didn't care. They didn't give me, thank God. And it's the only thing that pleased me about that catatonic state I was in. I kept taking my anxiety meds but felt worse and worse.

Warning ⚠️ TW Trigger Warning

There was a day that I grabbed an eyebrow liner, and I cut my arm along the length. I still have the five scars that cover my forearm as a reminder of one of many failed attempts to end my life. Sneaky a bit now by the amount of tattoos on my arms. Crying, I called the PAS line. PAS is a mental health help line in Puerto Rico managed by ASSMCA. When they told me they were going to send an ambulance to hospitalize me, I hid. I didn't want that. I remembered the times when I was taking my mother and all the medications she was taking and I was scared. I continued my treatment without the supervision of a psychiatrist until I was referred to APS. APS is a clinic here in Puerto Rico who specializes in Mental Health and manages a considerable amount of patients.

With APS my real struggle began. They prescribed my first antidepressant. Paxil. I was meant to take it once a day and continue the anxiety medication. I went to the pharmacy and when I looked at the antidepressant I started crying. I read a lot. And I read a lot more about Medicine topics as I already mentioned. I knew about the bad reputation of antidepressants as I also knew about their virtues. Either way, I didn't want to take them. My brother, my aunt, my mom and my grandfather were telling me to take it and give it a chance. The Google searches were unsettling. I was focusing more on the side effects than what could actually help me. I just thought that how could only two types of medications help me with all those mental diagnoses that I had. And it is added to my diagnoses: PTSD or Post Traumatic Syndrome and Grief. Yes, grief is a clinical diagnosis that must be managed by a specialist; my current psychologist is an expert in that area. Needless to say, the unopened jars of antidepressants are still lying around.

In March of this year I moved. I was happy because well, first, I would leave a house in which I only had losses and illness and many tragedies. I wanted a new life and I thought the move would help me. It helped me, but moving is also part of feeding your mental disorders.

Lying in bed day and night, I spent days without eating, looking at the moving boxes without unpacking ... The whole house was ready but my room was not. It was as if my body had been transferred from one house to another and I continued to doze as life passed by.

Warning ⚠️ TW Trigger Warning

The panic attacks did not stop. They were more and worse. I was crying to the emergency room and the doctor who saw me already knew me. They injected me with antipsychotics and benzodiazepines and went home. And this ritual continued until July. On July 19, I remember it like now, I looked at my medicine pot and started crying. I thought I was making no progress at all. I just wanted to die. Now I remember that I got dressed and went on foot, alone, without saying a word, to the emergency room. As I walked, I cried and scratched my arms drawing blood. I saw the cars go by and I just wanted to be passed over. I got to the hospital and the nurse sat me down and tried to calm me down. I only remember telling him: “I want to die. My life is worthless. I am a mental patient and I need help but no one gives it to me. ""

You know why? I had to look for help. And that day, the doctor who always helped me saw me and she told me that if I authorized her that she would confine me to a mental hospital. Crying I said yes. And with tears in her eyes she told me that I was going to be all right. And she began to make preparations for the transfer and hospitalization.

I was nervous. I will not tell my experience inside the mental hospital because it would already be a book. I can only summarize that the medications that I took for years, especially Clonazepam, were not right for me. It puts me in a more depressed state that I couldn't get out of. Nor could I leave it on my own because I could convulse from cutting off the intake suddenly. So my psychiatrist started playing with the drugs. I felt that my brain was like a DJ's turntable. I could feel how they played with my brain with so much medication that I received that acts on the Central Nervous System, and that balances the chemicals in the brain. On the second day they eliminated the Clonazepam. And there was the real awakening. It felt like a switch had been flipped in my brain that had been turned off all my life. Yes, my 40 years. With so many medication changes I felt strange. The panic attacks were 5 and 6 a day but I felt safe because I was in a place where they would help me. After so many talks with psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, nurses and others; finally, on the fifth or sixth day, the drug cocktail began to work. I felt weird, but somehow difficult to explain, I felt myself. It is as if they had crossed out my life for that period that I was in that spiral, colliding with existing logs in my mind and breaking my nails imaginatively trying to climb the dark and black well in which I was sunk. Two other diagnoses are added to the previous ones: Insomnia and Psychosis (racing thoughts, visual, tactile and auditory hallucinations, episodes of schizophrenia, and others).

There are four medications that I take daily, and six doses a day. I take Sertraline (Zoloft), Lorazepam (Ativan) three times a day, Temazepam (Restoril) and Quetiapine Fumarate (Seroquel). With this new panorama I began a new stage in my life. I knew that it was necessary for me to take medication and psychotherapy. Sometimes I look back and wonder why I didn't do it sooner. But quickly I thank God that I was able to stand up and say ""I need help."" Because I couldn't alone.

I can't deny that being aware of so many medications, appointments, and so on bothers me a bit, but I have to. For me, for my children. I cried with my children remembering the dark moments I spent curled up in bed. A body that seemed inert, that seemed to feel nothing, was feeling everything.

Warning ⚠️ TW Trigger Warning

As for my anxiety and my depression, they have no cure, only treatment, but I am willing to continue working with my mind and my body to be stable. Stable. That is the correct word. Not bad or good, stable. Because nothing is magic, there are days and there are days. From my PTSD I was able to overcome entering the kitchen. Yes, after my husband died, I couldn't go into the kitchen. If I looked I would just recreate the scene of his death over and over again. Now, almost two years after his death, I can say that I am cooking as before. There are days when I do have hallucinations and I see him lying there. But I struggle with my mind and I can keep myself in the kitchen doing what I was doing.

Today, I can say that I feel stable. That I am not ashamed to say that I am a mental patient. That I am not ashamed of having sought help. That I do not regret having looked for it. Now I can smile and enjoy life with my children and remember the good times with my beloved husband who May Rest In Peace.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading. I could have written much more, but there are things that are not told to everyone nor do I find the need. The message I want to carry through this story is that we should not be ashamed or embarrassed about seeking help when it comes to mental health. Let's put the stigma aside. Talk to your psychologist, tell him how you feel. Take the medication. Pray to God or take refuge in your religious belief if you have one. Be happy. The glass is half full, not half empty. Help exists. I want myself alive and I want you alive too. You're not alone. If you are suffering from a mental problem, the help is real. I looked for it and it gaves me back the will to live. I have gone back to dreaming, reading, putting on makeup; in short, my hobbies. Needless to say, I am extremely proud of what I have done with my life. And the missing path will be one of blessings in the name of God.

If you feel that this summary of my story can help someone, you can confidently share. Moreover, I would love for you to do so, because this way these words can reach more people who may need to read them.",1

When I went to the USA for college my sister was so envious that my mother financed me my education there and got more furious when I got accepted into med school. She said ""my sister and med school? She cant do it, she is too anxious, she is too this and that"". I quit med school because I had NO self-esteem, I felt in the wrong place because people around me told me I am not good enough for it. I went back to the USA in order to finish my other degree and then the pandemic came. My mother initiated that I come back to Europe and leave my boyfriends house because he was betraying me behind my back. She wanted me to be home in Europe and I wanted to stay in the USA because I just settled there and had success in college for the first time. Then my dad, my aunt etc. insisted that I fly back home. I flew back home because they made me anxious about the pandemic and then I was stuck home with my mum again.
I had difficulties keeping up with college because I totally felt isolated from abroad. My mum gave me a hard time because she said how expensive this education is and that I should do something in Europe. I wanted to finish it but had a bad feeling and felt ashamed that she paid so much for online classes. Its like she did not see that I did well before and all the hard work I put into the courses, she only said that it is too expensive instead of supporting me and it furstrated me that I was stuck home with her. I had a job in the USA to finance my studies but I went back home so I had to quit. My whole family is like this, not supporting my dream to study in the USA, just being fine with it but not really supportive. She just bought herself three cars in one month but makes me feel ashamed that I want to finish something. I finally quit college a year ago in the USA and since then I am struggling to find something to do. I feel low and behind in life because my friends already complete their Masters Degrees and ask me what I am doing right now. I fell into a huge depression, I quit jobs and just want to disappear. I am a loser. Today my mum said she doesnt want anything to do with me. I told the family chat that I am no longer going to participate in this group due to my mum. My aunt just texted me that I have a weird dynamic with my mother but that it would only be consequent to finance myself when I quit contact with her. I felt so sad because I just needed emotional support and all my aunt said that I need to finance myself now. It has nothing to do with me quitting contact with my mum and that this shitty pandemic came and my family wanted me back home is not all my fault.
I feel like I do not want to live anymore. I am always the one who has to explain herself to others and apologise to them. The whole famiy has a narcissistic dynamic where everyone wants to feel better than the other. I am so sick and tired of it. The only one who is not participating in it is my dad but he lives in a different country. I feel like I have NO home, nowhere to go, I feel totally lost with no direction to go. I dont feel sorry to not have my mum in my life anymore. She is triggering me so much it is unbelievable. I actually feel relieved that I do not have to talk to her anymore. She makes me feel like my emotions arent valued and that what I am feeling is wrong and that I have a wrong perception about what is happening around me but I DO feel sad and angry at her and the way she treats me but then she makes herself as the victim and says I am exploiting her generous nature.
I have no Idea what to do next, I just to be happy, but dont know what to do. Would you guys finish college with the help of your dad or just go to work and let go of your dreams? Anyone an idea on how to deal with this? One part of me just wants to disappear, the other part wants to fight and finally let go of all of this.",1
"Its been like it for a year now even though it is better now due to restrictions being lifted. I go to uni and it takes my mind off it for a bit but as soon as i go back to my room it all just sets in again. This feeling i cant really describe like hopelessness no matter what i do its always there in my mind, music is the only thing keeping me going at this point and my family. I have one friend who ive known since we were kids and thats the only friend ive ever had in my life and we dont even talk much anymore seeing as we both went to different unis.

I have a ""friend"" at uni and then another guy who we both talk to. They are always going out and doing things and i dont think ive once been invited. i just want someone to talk to. I have no idea how to make friends and even when i am around other people it feels like there's a barrier around me from connecting with anyone. Feel like such an outcast.

I dont think ive ever had friends were we just hang out and chat or go round to each others house casually always see posts about people hanging out and stuff. I cant talk to people either feel like im trapped like this forever. Anyway feels good to say something and type it out here.",1
"I turn 26 in two weeks and I’m a fucking loser. My bank closed my account for being severely overdrawn (the daily overdraft fees fucked me over so bad), I am borderline homeless, no job, no insurance, no family, complete loss of humanity, energy, sex drive, overall interest in life… it’s all just gone. I feel tired every day and I sleep 15 hours a day without even meaning to. I cut my family off two months ago for good this time after they let me down and abandoned me for the last time, and it’s especially hard around this time of year. I’m going to miss spending Christmas in a nice cozy warm home with the people who are supposed to love me unconditionally. I’ll never have that again. I don’t know what to do anymore I need to find a job as soon as I can but I’m so deep in the hole that most of my initial paychecks are going to go towards paying off my bank so I can start turning a profit. My car registration is 2 and a half years outdated and I still drive it but if I get pulled over I’m fucked. I also don’t think it’s registered in my name. I’m rambling. FML. I wish I could just start over. I wish I had a family who loved me and would help me make sense of my situation and lend me a hand. I’m so alone.",1
"I'm young, I have no motivation to do anything, have been laying in my bed every day all day basically doing nothing, I have no future, I'm in pain, I'm in a relationship and when I got into it I actually felt better. But now it's going to shit too. I've tried offing myself before, but I chickened out the last second.

I smoke cigarettes pretty often, drink energy drinks, don't eat almost anything. Because of how I'm being treated by the person I love the most I started feeling sooo much stress. I'm constantly shaking, crying, feeling nauseous, sometimes puke after eating too(not on purpose).

I don't know what to do anymore... I'm not good enough in anyones eyes, no one genuinely cares, and it's probably the thing that I fear the most: people that I love treating me like a piece of trash that they want to throw out as fast as they can. And it's actually starting to happen.

I've been in this state for long enough and I'm tired of trying to find strength without succeeding..",1
I’m so fucking depressed and don’t see a way out. I’m so miserable and worthless and everything has become so bitter. I just cut myself but I even failed at that. I wish I could cut deeper.,1
I don’t want to go to work not because I don’t like it but because I feel I don’t deserve it . I’m a idiot who can’t even talk right . A kid actually tried to talk to me and I almost ignored them because I don’t know how to talk to anyone. I’m tired all the time even now . My body feels heavy I just want to relax. Everything about me is embarrassing . I don’t deserve any job or anything in life . I don’t deserve to exist,1
I'm just sitting here crying. I wanted to try to reach out on here and then decided otherwise. There's nothing to say anymore. Why should I bother to speak? Speaking presumes someone is listening. Hopefully that person is at least understanding and kind. No one is listening and no one cares.,1
"In general if someone said that they are not ready for serious relationship, then people says move on! Because the actual meaning is that they don’t want a serious relationship with you(you are not enough interesting to them). If a person who suffers from depression and anxiety said that he is not ready for anything serious because his priority is recovering mental health, does it imply the same meaning that he is not interested in developing emotion and relationship “with me“ ? would it be time wasting to date with him if what I want is a serious deep relationship? He was sure that he is dating only one person at a time (he paused his dating apps, though he did not delete the apps) 
It has been 4 months to see each other twice a week, and he said he wouldn’t see me if he was not enjoying seeing me.",1
"These are the worst thoughts I've had in awhile so I created this account just to share them.

I laid in bed and cried. Drunk. I haven't had these feelings of wanting to kill myself in awhile. I wanted to die so bad. I thought about how much I hated myself. I hate my thoughts. I hate my feelings. I couldn't breathe. I didn't want to feel any of it anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought about how confused my child would be without me and that brought me back as I drifted off to sleep. Feeling much better today, and could use some time away from the bottle... probably.",1
"I'm the most decrepit, horrible, useless, worthless, idiotic, stupid, ugly, uncultured, self-pitying, pathetic excuse of a person anyone could ever have the displeasure of meeting. I deserve to die already.

I barely share anything in common with anyone I meet. I have no skills. I don't have a job. I don't have a life. I don't have friends in real life. I don't speak any languages other than my home language (which I refuse to associate myself with because I have a mongrel complex) and English. I don't have a good relationship with my family. I don't deserve to live. I'm a fucking idiot.

How anyone can even remotely like me is a complete and utter enigma. I have nothing worth loving or cherishing.

I wish I could stomach alcohol so I could at least drown my sorrows, but I'm such a fucking pussy that I cringe when I have *coffee*.

I wish I had the courage to die, but I'm too much of a fucking pussy. I should've died in the womb like the disgrace I am. Everyone would be happier.

I'm worthless. I just need to be put down like the sick dog I am already.",1
"Has anyone here tried out better help? I can't really afford therapy right now and even though better help markets itself as affordable, i still haven't really been in a position to take that financial hit. With december around the corner, I'm going to get my holiday bonus soon and that will pretty much be the only time i can afford to try better help without putting other bills at risk. But at the same time, I don't want to waste the money if people say it's not worth it or if it's a bad service in general.",1
"im almost 17 now and the past 3 years have been the worst years for me, i got into severe depression and been thinking of ending it all everyday for these past years, but why shouldnt i just do it and end it? i mean it would stop the pain at least, maybe?",1
"The next day I read what I wrote makes me feel uncomfortable or even a little bit cringe. What does that mean? Why am I feeling this way

I hope no one ever finds what I wrote and confronts me. I wouldn't know what to say",1
I feel like absolute shit and I haven't gotten out of my bed for two days. I have no one to talk to because I feel like I'm annoying all of my friends with my bullshit. I don't want to bother my best friend because she's at her boyfriend's house but she's the only one I feel comfortable talking to about my depression. I really don't know what to do anymore I felt so great a few days ago but now I'm back at one of my lowest points in quite a while.,1
"I have talked with therapists long term, short term, take meds, etc. Now I talk with crisis counselors on the suicide hotline (and I have spoken with the youth line in the past) and all this pain and fatigue and despair isn't going away. Now all I hear is people telling me to cope. Distract myself. Try to do something I like.


Is this forever? Is it all just staving off the depression day by day, coping strategy by coping strategy, forever? Is it getting lost in books so I don't have to face the real world, forever now?

I believed I would get better. Now I'm not so sure. I don't know how to cope with the coping (cope-ception?). Like an eternal spiral down down, with no end.",1
I need answers. I have no motivation to school work or find new people to talk to. I barely get sleep and always have no energy. Im shy and dont like being social. I mostly lose motivation because of how lonely i am. There is a girl i like but i know i cant ask her out and know im unlikable. All my good friends dont care about me anymore. I want to lose weight but dont have the motivation nor tools to do that. What can I do or how to motivate myself so i dont have to live this life anymore? I dont know if i have mental issues,1
Yeah that's pretty much it any help is appreciated thanks,1
"Good Day my fellow survivalists!! I just wanted to tell you that it's not you that's depressed, it's the world we live in that's depressed... and depressing... Forcing everyone to look and act a certain a way...to be the ""right"" way and anyone who disagrees or doesn't fit in with the agenda will be shunned...cast out is what's depressing, not the individual who's labeled as depressed. Those that control you know that humans function better being in groups and so it's our nature to want acceptance and to be able to fit in... which is a survival instinct that is now being used against many people.. especially the depressed. Your govt and therapist knows what I'm about to tell you is true... But I've been accused of spreading hopelessness, helplessness, and fear mongering-mostly and ironically accused of these things by spiritualists and religious people. Your depression is not your fault... Your mind and emotions are simply being affected by the disturbing and questionable reality and world in which we live in. I believe depression started when humans weren't able to live the way they wanted to...the way we were designed to live which is...freely and not in economical or religious bondage! *Excluding the mentally insane, rapists and murderers of course...those are people with mental problems who I'm not referring to that should be able to live freely btw...* Again, the depressed are actually just fine.. it's simply the world that's depressing, not the individual.
A world, and by world, I mean those in control of it, that has only one thing it wants from you-to control you...to make you a robot to do exactly what they want you to do...and to look a certain way...act a certain way...be this way, not that way... If you don't adhere to these rules, you'll be shunned, or outed as a crazy person or said to be depressed-which triggers your psychological instinct that acceptance offers survival and if you're different you won't survive. This might sound random but people fear artificial intelligence and robots taking over...hate to say it but we're already there. There's not much difference programming an AI/robot to make it do what you want it to do, than training, conditioning and programming a human to do what you want them to do either through media, education and religion-all control constructs by the way. When these robots don't perform the way they're suppose to, much like when humans don't think or respond the way they're ""supposed"" to in their torturous environment-they're put away and considered defective-..same as robots... Siri and Alexa are no different than you and I... as far as programming goes... I'll stop here but if you're depressed, it's not your fault, you've done nothing wrong. We're all unfortunately living in a depressive, oppressive, suggestive, highly questionable world that likes to use reverse psychology, education, media, religion and conditioning to control the masses and make you think you're the ""depressed"" one and giving you boatloads of therapy and medication to help take the heat off of them. Honestly, the entire world should be depressed bc of the world we live in but denial and conditioning is powerful... There are others who aren't depressed or fazed by our sham existence, and they can move through life unfazed and unbothered as long as they are winning, thinking ""positively"", or ""contributing"" in their mind.. but this mentality to ""get like me"" or ""get over it"" is mind control, toxic, and shouldn't be yelled at anyone who's *rightfully* depressed who knows or feels otherwise. I consider many depressed souls like myself to be the enlightened...seeing through the veils and societal constructs that do more harm than good. Maybe if the world we live in didn't suck, people wouldn't be suicidal or depressed. I'm simply saying there's a lot to be depressed about, more often than not. *Disclaimer: I am speaking strictly about depression non related to diagnosed mental illness where people need daily medication, therapy, or monitoring to function...(or so they've been told.)*",1
"I feel like crying. I don’t know why.
I feel like such a failure in life. I wish I could just disappear.
Everything I do feels pointless sometimes. Why keep fighting and trying so hard?",1
"I’m 21, and for the last 18 months I’ve been dealing with chronic gastrointestinal pain. It all started with food poisoning from sushi and my life has just unraveled since then. 

I had to stop taking classes from being unable to focus since the pain seeps through my concentration. I now live with my parents again away from my campus and I haven’t been able to do anything resembling regular life since then. Prior to that was Covid, so I haven’t actually been in college for 2 and a half years now. I’m 15 credits from graduation but unable to reach it and I just feel like it’s all been a waste. I don’t have friends because I haven’t been there, my friends from high school have all moved on with their lives. 

My girlfriend of a year left me because I’m unable to care for myself so I couldn’t do relationship-type things that she wanted to do. I’ve also lost 50 pounds, most of which was muscle tbh because I was really into working out prior to my illness, so the person I see in the mirror is someone I don’t even recognize, both in mind and body. 

I’ve been to hundreds of doctor appointments and no one has any solutions to truly help me, just to cope with the pain. This is a pain that’s so severe I can’t go to the grocery store, I can’t eat most things because I’ll throw up, and I don’t even bother going to the ER anymore because they’ll dismiss me almost immediately after seeing my charts. 

I was using marijuana medicinally because it helped my pain more than the 50 prescriptions I’ve tried but I overdid it with smoking. I’ll be the first one to admit it became an addiction of pain medication, but I was desperate and it turned into cannabinoid hydremesis syndrome so I’ve been unable to use marijuana for 2 months now. Truthfully I don’t miss anything about it other than the hour long respite it would give me from my agony, how I miss that time.

I have nothing left to live for, everything I thought I cared about is gone or so far from reach it might as well be. I don’t even know what to do anymore. How do you guys get through the day, pass the time?",1
"I’m feeling very suicidal

I’m young for feeling this so no one believes me for years now I’ve felt this multiple times I’ve sat on bridges debating until someone tells me to go or they will call police cuz I might jump I can’t talk to anyone cuz one of my best friends is suicidal but everyone knows so only pays attention to them they also had trauma from events I won’t speak I don’t want to put more weight on others but I can’t handle one more day in this hell ish life I just want to end it all I’m not happy never will be the only times I feel not numb is when I drag the cold blade through my wrists",1
"Hi I’m a 32 year old male who is in a long term relationship with a 25 year old female. She has fell into a place that I’ve never seen her in before. She has always been anxious and very emotional about things but never like this. It’s hard to get her to do things. She swears up and down it’s not me and I believe her but I’m trying to do my best to help but I’m not sure what to do. We’ve have some life changes happening in the coming months. All good things but still stressful. I’ve had my own problems in the past, addiction, but I’ve been sober over 4 years now. I was taught to deal with things somewhat differently than she understands. I’ve offered therapy but she doesn’t want to. She wants to try medicine first. I’m just clueless what to do and feel somewhat helpless. Just looking for suggestions. Thanks!",1
"It's been about a month and a half. I thought i had found somebody to accept that im depressed most of the time. Was honestly pretty happy with it. All good things come to an end i guess, but if youre depressed, you cant tell when they begin. I've been isolated from the world since i was 10. Always felt stupid. Always felt defective. I dont know what to do with myself man. I just dont know",1
"I’m curious about something. As adults dealing with serious depression, how many here have felt or actually been compelled look outwardly as much as (if not more than) inwardly about what’s going on in society and in the in the world generally that could explain all this depression in more and more and younger and younger people?

How many of you are involved with charitable/political/civic/social/environmental organizations, movements, or causes, or at least consider yourself politically, economically, or socially conscious?",1

"I'm a 19 year old autistic female. I've always had issues with friends and stuff but anyway I have a huge question atm.. not sure of anyone can help but at least I'm getting this off my chest. So I'm a the college for (as you know) autistic or additional needs people. I really really DO NOT want to be nasty or a disrespectful but really and truly I'm literally the ONLY person there who is capable or ""high functioning"". Anyway, the question is why do the staff and teachers treat me like I'm so kind of dumbass or I'm not capable at doing anything? Again I'm not saying this to be rude about other's difficulties. But damn I really hate it! When I'm look around the staff is talking to one another like ""normal"" beings but when it comes to me they act so stupid. I'm a bloody 19 year old woman! 19!! Treat me as a bloody adult not a damn child or a dumbass. Yes I know its college and it's the curriculum but wow.",1
"I've had depression for about 13 years now, being 26(M) and getting it around 13. At first it only lasted a day, maybe two at the most. My hobbies, friends and family didn't bring me may happiness and all I could do was lay in bed and wallow in self pity/hatred.

Here I am all these years later, and this depression episode has been going on for at least two weeks, going on three. I got a new job, I broke this off with my abusive ex, started to rebuild my relationship with my parents. Eight months ago I made a huge stride forward and now it feels like I'm falling right back down to the bottom slowly but surely. 

I don't want to kill myself, but fuck I don't want to live either.",1
"I’m about a month out from the end of the semester and am absolutely, miserably behind in two of my classes. I could probably make up the work if I really tried but it feels like my brain is broken and won’t let me. As the assignments pile up, I find myself wishing I could just be hospitalized so I at least have an excuse for all this. At least then I can rest. I’m not suicidal, but if there were a way to be induced into a coma for a month and wake up like normal afterwards I would absolutely take it. I’ve been looking up ways to hurt myself bad enough to end up in the hospital but not bad enough to have permanent side effects. And then I feel like such a coward because I know that hospitals are already low on resources and I would just be taking the bed from someone who needs it more. But I can’t stop fantasizing. I imagine pressing my hand to the stovetop and leaving it there while my hand burns, or “accidentally” taking too much medication. I’ve been getting very little sleep lately, and I tell myself that it’s because I’m studying but really I’m hoping I get tired enough that I just collapse. I have a therapist but I feel like my brain is too “stuck” for anything to work.",1
"after suffering for 4 years, i just one day just stopped giving a fuck, cuz nothing matters we live in a fucking ball in the middle of nothing and everything. So why waste my life, just do what you want, we are gonna day anyway",1
"I can’t get anywhere in life even when I’m doing better. They said they don’t think I can handle the time commitment because this is my first semester taking a full load of classes since 2018. How embarrassing. I’m taking 12 credits, volunteering once a week, helping with social media for a program, and doing 1-2 hours of meetings for a program right now. But they don’t think I can handle an internship because of my pathetic gap. It’s seriously so depressing I’m having a freaking mental breakdown. I’ll never get hired anywhere now. Sorry for taking time off to work on my mental health. Guess that’s seen as a bad thing in the professional world.",1
"I have a photographic memory and this seems like a curse for people with depression, because I am able to remember traumatic events that happened in childhood as if it were a video of a movie and watch it in third person, but feeling all the negative emotions of the event as if it had happened yesterday. 
For example, I remember the first time I considered suicide, before I was 5 years old, because my mother would repeatedly say how horrible her life had become after I was born and that my father wished she had had an abortion.
She said this whenever she fought with my father and he left the house (which happened every week) since I was born, but only after the first death in the family (I was 4 years old) and the understanding of what death was , was that I saw it as a solution to the problems.
At that time, I thought that abortion would encompass every death committed by the mother to the child, even if it had already been born. I had not yet glimpsed the meaning of murder and infanticide.",1
"My mom and dad argue every alternate night,my mom is very sick and weak still my dad beats her and makes us feel guilty for being financially dependent on him I've hypothyroidism and my mental health is already down the road I am crying while typing this I have great ambitions I aspired to become something really great in future I am good at studies,quite disciplined but because of my parents arguements I always endup in a depressed lonely place and because of which I am behind every class lecture homework portion.they say it gets better but it never does.i am giving up on everything.world was a nice place I wanted to visit countries meet people but I don't think I will ever be able to do that.",1
"I didn’t feel loved since I was around 9 years old, at that time my grandparents which I loved moved far away and I stayed with my mom and her boyfriend. My mom was never good at expressing emotions and even though I know she loves me she never expressed those feelings to me, so I never fully got the maternal love. Oftentimes it felt like my mom was more interested in alcohol and her boyfriend so I was pretty much neglected all my childhood.

Her latest boyfriend was the most toxic person I have vet known and he made my life a living hell. I’ve been depressed since mom got with him when I was 12 years old and it felt like he took her away from me and she wasn’t strong enough to leave the relationship which was abusive for both of us 

I was also fat since I was little. Never felt attractive or wanted, no one ever flirted with me and as a 23 year old have never been intimate with someone. I managed to loose a lot of weight and dropped to a normal size, but as a “souvenir” I struggle with loose skin which makes me so damn self conscious. My best friend who also struggled with loose skin got surgery to remove it and I can see how much it helped her with self esteem and worth and it’s damn hard to see and be happy about it when I feel triggered every time she speaks about it. 

My grandma projected her eating disorders and body issues on me, so I’ve been struggling with unhealthy eating behaviour since I was little.

As a cherry on top I am gay which I’ve. never felt bad about, mainly because I was struggling so much with other aspects of my life I never had time to actually struggle with my sexual orientation.

It feels like all people close to me either traumatised me, left me or trigger me and I don’t know what to do, I feel so lost in life and am struggling every day. I guess I just needed to vent",1
"This is my second year of high school 
There was a girl who faked a friendship with me made sure that I got feelings for her and that I would be harassed because I cared to much about her. Once I told a friend that I was worried about her then I was harassed by people saying that I was planning on raping her she lead it all for the background she even got someone to try to fight me I then realized that she was trying to get me to kill myself so I vent to a friend that I was mad at her for that she then took me to court were both her and her mother said that I am the worst person ever her mother then said after the judge which they lied to BTW that the girl has for the whole been going into a shell and didn't smile but I have seen her smile and then her mom said that she feels bad for what I had to go through and she is happy that I feel better even though both of them lied and said that I was going to shoot up the school",1
"Today I found out that a year ago my best friend was about to kill himself. The only reason he didn't was just as he was about to his friend rang and he took that as a sign to not go ahead. I am so fucking grateful for that.

Anyway this got me thinking, what if he had gone ahead? And I realised how badly so many people would have been affected.

For one, me and him never would have become such good friends, and if we hadn't then most likely I wouldn't have found my reason to keep going. Us and a few other people formed a friend around that time last year, a couple people left and a couple joined as time went on, but me and him never left. If he wasn't around that group probably never would have been formed, and as my friends are my reason to carry on, I never would have had a good argument for staying alive, so I'd have most likely killed myself by now. 

Not only that, most of my friends are people who no one else wants to talk to, and if we hadn't introduced them to eachother they probably never would have talked at all, and they would have been all alone,maybe even resulting in them becoming depressed themselves.

Furthermore, I never would have met my boyfriend if it wasn't for my friends. He has depression, and he tried to kill himself before he met me, I'm the main reason he keeps going. If my friend I mentioned before had killed himself, me and my boyfriend never would have met, and he might have been dead by now too.

His parents would also have been broken, and his siblings, and his pets. And the friend who rang him would have been broken too, he would have been crushed, even if he didn't show it.

And if he had killed himself, and I had gone on to do the same,and then more had followed, that is so many families who would have been absolutely torn to pieces over it.

So all in all, if it wasn't for that one phone call, at least 3 people would most likely have killed themselves this year, maybe more. But because he didn't kill himself, none of that went on to happen. And now he's happy and I'm getting happier and my boyfriend finally has someone to fight for and my friends aren't alone. 

So whenever you feel like there's no point sticking around and it's all gone to hell, please remember that just you still being here could be a catalyst for a snowball of good things, you might be saving someone's life right now without even knowing it! 

Just remember, a backlash from a suicide is devastating, it may not be at the time but in the future, when someone needs someone else to be there for them and that person was supposed to be you, what are they gonna do? You can't be there because you're dead, and if there's no one else to be there for that person they might end up the same. It's the smallest things that make the biggest difference ok? Just please, wait a little longer, find the person who needs you, because they exist, and they DO need you, even if they don't know it themselves yet. You got this.",1

"From the outside I look like I have my life together. I’m 28(f), work in commercial real estate and look presentable. My hair is usually done, little make up, and I dress well for work. But on the inside I’m a mess. 
Lately I’ve really been struggling to do anything at work. Since we are solely commission, this has reflected my work. I haven’t had a single paycheck come to me in over 6 months. I can’t afford anything. My bank accounts have completely depleted and I can’t even afford a place to call home. 
I haven’t been a good friend. I can barely text back, make time for them. Yet I don’t let them know how I am because they don’t get it. 
My parents don’t get it either and I think that’s what hurts the most. 
My mom will basically call me lazy without actually saying it but complain about my room saying each article of clothing I leave on the floor will cost me $100 (which lol I don’t even have). Saying I never like working. And always after a few months I want to quit. And that’s usually because of my depression. 
HOW DO YOU GUYS WORK. How do you support yourselves? I miss being on my own. No one to judge me if I want to be in bed all day, or throw clothes on the ground because I can’t mentally clean at the moment. I miss Having money. I miss feeling ok. I miss me. And this is all I know now.",1
"Hi, I’ve been struggling with depression for about 4 years now plus BPD and because of that I dropped out of high school and never got my degree. I’m almost 22 now and started senior year this September. However, stress and exams quickly made my depression worse and I barely can make myself go to school, let alone keep up with homework, exams, chores and therapy. I’ve spent this whole month in bed, I’m back on antidepressants but I’ve completely fallen out of my routines (exercising, reading and sleep schedule). I find it really difficult to wake up on time and I feel so exhausted all the time I can’t get anything done.
I dropped out because of burn out from overworking myself but now, with the help of therapy, I’m working on managing my expectations as well as mood swings/bpd related symptoms.

Could you please share any tips on how to be productive while dealing with the exhaustion that comes with depression?",1
"TW : mentions of S/H, mental health struggles, abuse, if you’re easily affected by these topics, click off. I never went there before but lately I’ve been feeling so fucking horrible, I live in an abusive household and I’ve always tried to tell myself they’re not worth hurting myself over but I just feel so fucking sad and horrible. It’s a very small cut and it drew blood and it doesn’t even count, it’s just a skin coloured thing in the shape of a scar on my wrist with a paper thin line of skin where there was blood leaking out of before I took care of it. I have nobody to talk to and my mother has always fear mongered me into not telling anyone or I’ll be taken away, since I have such bad attendance, the school is already considering sending in safe guarding/to check if everything is okay at home. The first time I tried telling someone about my mother and how abusive my family is, my therapist just said that I’m sure your mother loves you, because she already got to them before me. They don’t see what I see, hear what I hear. They don’t see the same people I do. I just want to sleep forever. I sound so edgy like I’m trying to be fake depressed or something, to be honest, I don’t know if I’m even depressed or not, because I mean I get up and brush my teeth and stuff and take care of my skincare. The only sport I wanted to use to improve myself and my mental health, my mother is taking ages to sort out and arrange lessons. I’ve been ignoring showering though and people’s rooms are usually messier, but I just have a few clothes stuffed under my bed. So am I really depressed? I feel like I am, I just don’t know. And my sister is/has already been suicidal, and I’ve been jealous of her before so they’ll probably think I’m doing this for attention. I’ve also told my family I’ve had suicidal thoughts before but they’ve always been nice for a day and then reverted back to how they were.
I’ve tried throwing myself down the staircase three times but I don’t know if that counts. I don’t know, I feel so alone and I want help but I have nobody to ask. I feel trapped and I cry almost everyday and I just, feel horrible. Or when I tell my mother that I don’t like what she says to me, she just says Fine, I won’t tell you anything in a condescending tone. And that just makes me feel more isolated. My parents willl be so disappointed. They’ve always said they didn’t want me to be like my sister but they’ve already planted the seeds. I don’t even know if this is depression or me being hormonal or overdramatic, I just feel so horrible I want to die. My mother doesn’t physically abuse me just verbally, emotionally and mentally",1
I want to disappear and go somewhere I can be at peace with myself. I just want to be alone in nature and not have to answer to anything. I have chosen the wrong path in life and I feel like there is no escape. I do not have it in me to kill myself as my family is the only thing I still care about. I hate myself and I often feel like I do not know who I am. I just want to live in seclusion so I don't have to feel this shame and guilt.,1
"I called my sister who lives 1,400 miles away from me last night to tell her that for the last few weeks I have been having intrusive thoughts. I suffer from PTSD that has cascaded to a gargantuan amount of daily fear. Dogs barking, people being nice or getting to close, it all creates images of death and violence in my head that I can't escape. laying on the floor doing yoga? can't do that because someone will come in and smash my skull into the floor. turning on the blender to make a smoothie? the sound of the blender is too loud and I am afraid that I wont hear people breaking into my house. I am paralyzed with imagined fear from my past. I think about how I want to be better and healthy for my son but I don't even have an image of myself that isn't obscured. I feel like I am loosing myself to the darkness. 

I know I need help but I am a single mom and I am afraid if I tell my healthcare professional that my son will be taken to his fathers house. which wouldn't be a bad thing if his dad wasn't a herion addict who lives like a pig. 

I just want to feel like I am alive and breathing instead of allowing my body to melt between shades of darkness.",1
"For so long I had wanted to die. I even had moments where I thought about ending it all but ultimately was too scared to do so. But now? Now I have a health scare and I now realize that I no longer want to die. I’m scared that my life could be cut short. I’m still not happy. My life still isn’t what I want it to be, not even close. I’m definitely still depressed. But I guess I now know that there is hope there for me. Even just a little glimmer of light because I no longer want to be gone from this earth. I want to see what life has in store for me. Now I just hope I live long enough to hopefully find happiness.",1

"I was a pretty non-serious student who graduated from an average college and got an average job as a fresher, after staying jobless for two years. Due to circumstances and to support the family, I was forced to take a job in Admin that was a total 4 hours commute back and forth, a toxic boss and mediocre pay. This job was sucking the life out of me and I was desperately looking for a job closer to my home. After surviving a year, I got an offer for a Retail Sales position that offered me the same salary but offered commission and was much closer to my home. I immediately accepted the offer as our financial position didn’t give me the luxury to take a break and find the ideal job. However, I didn’t realise that I actually shot my myself in the feet because now I’m stuck in a role for nearly 5 years that I just took on out of desperation. I’m almost 30, single and live with my mother(I’m not from the west). My brother is also working but his job also doesn’t pay very grand. Expenses are increasing but my salary is the same, as our company isn’t paying commissions like it used to, post covid. I now realise how massively wrong career choices can affect you. I never thought I’d work a retail job and work night shifts. I’m desperately applying for Business Development roles to get out of retail, but it is incredibly to find a better job without making shit up. My job has ruined my life. I suffer from crippling depression due to financial stress, no social life as I have distanced myself from friends who are doing far better than me in life. I literally fucking hate myself.",1
Splitting time with my daughter is absolutely destroying my life &amp; who I am as a person. I no longer find joy in anything except for the borrowed time that I have with her.

"There are times where the state I’m in now is infinitely worse than before. I was still miserable back then, but I had so much hope for myself. Even as I poorly compartmentalized my suffering to try to seem normal. Even as I wanted to kill myself over and over. Even when I failed every activity in front of me, I still had so much hope for myself. I would get better, I really would.

There are days I mourn that person. She had so much hope for me, and now I can’t even look myself in the eyes because I know better. Things will never get better. I will never reach a state where I can be relieved that I’m alive, just that it’s not as painful and it’s easier to pretend I’m a functional person now.

I’m really upset and angry, but also somehow empty and numb. This disease robbed everything from me, and fractured my perception of the world beyond repair. How am I supposed to be okay with that? How am I supposed to cope with that?",1

Even though I'm getting exceptionally high marks in school , I don't feel any joy or sense of accomplishment.

"I wrote a note about 2 years ago when I wanted to die. I had planned it all in my head: the moment I get my license, I'll run into a tall tree and die. It would seem like an accident and so my parents would never have to hang their heads low in society and I factored that in because they REALLY care about what everyone else thinks lol. I jokingly told my best friend that if an instance like that were to ever occur to look for a file called ""traffic"" on my laptop. Little did she know that it had already been written out.

Fast forward to a year ago, I got it- the drivers' license and all I ever thought about while driving was ending my life. I was so scared of my own thoughts that after the smallest parking lot accident, I decided to stop driving altogether. 

It's been a year since and I've been going to therapy and I've been dealing with my shit. So much has happened and I am finally seeing a little bit of light. I saw the note today and I did not want to read it. I did not want to remember the sadness and so I deleted it. I hope the light does not dim out.",1

"Like nearly everything, there are bad things that happen to you, but I always try to find the funny/another side of it.

Think about buying yourself a house, and living in it, waking up, going to the gym, learning alone until you understand the subject, going for a bicycle ride. Think about swimming, diving, parachuting. Buying your favorite clothes, shoes. Chilling in your house with your favorite homemade lemonade. Think about the films which will come out. You have friends, think about how many fun things you can do, like ordering a pizza and taking it over while being in underwear.

"Throughout my life, I've had multiple issues with my cognition and physical health. My memory has been the biggest burden, I have had difficulties recalling short term and long term events, these, are only recalled if someone gives me a hint of what could've happened or If I try very hard allowing me to remember very vaguely, yet, that's not always the case and it depends if it was a somehow important event. I have difficulties assigning memories with age, periods or dates. My most vivid memories come from the last 4 years or since I was 17. 

With that said, the last 3 years I've been ruminating and investigating about my issues allowing me to become more aware of my health. I hope I can provide enough context of what I've been able to gather from this experience and from anecdotes of third parties. I'll try to explain the events in a timeline for reference.

When I was 3-4 years old my arm used to dislocate and had to been put back to place constantly. The doctors said it was not a big concern.

I was apparently a great student until 3rd grade (Age 7-8) which is worth mentioning as everything after that went downhill in terms of concentration and memory.

At around age 9-13 I began having feet problems. I'm pretty sure this is the same issue I experience nowadays which is pain in the outer side of the feet. This pain is caused by either standing for too long, doing exercise (running, soccer) or wearing tight shoes and it can be described as a pinched nerve or being very close to a cramp and it develops as I keep pressurising the area. My mom took me to a traumatologist whom said my feet is half flat and sent me to use special shoes for school as well as a custom made insoles (rubber and soft plastic)

One of the doctors told my mom that this will fade away as I grew up for some reason.

One occasion I did a school 2km marathon I did pretty well but I arrived at the finish line crying and the pain was unbearable.

The nights and afterdays of a soccer match were accompanied with feet pain and tingling as well as very bad body inflammation in all my joints areas.

All this pain became a regular and I have always been an active person no matter the circumstances.

At age 16, I started going to the gym and doing very light weights. This became a standard and I was always able to reach failure with those weights and small reps, meaning, that when I tried to build strength I realised that I was very weak and as much as I tried to go up weights I could never go past my regular capacity. With this I realised my strength is weak or my bones or inflammation wouldn't allow it, nonetheless, I got very big as I was always achieving close to failure and that developed my muscles yet not my strength. Also the day after gym will be accompanied with muscle pain everytime.

Coming back to my academical performance, I was very lazy and lethargic. I believed I became like this for my inability to concentrate and do mental tasks for long periods of time. The way that I coped with all of that was by plagiarizing and somehow always managed to get enough for a pass. In that time I thought it was due to just being lazy and careless and felt that I just needed purpose. 

When I came to Australia (18 years old) and finally was able to study what I really liked, I saw myself with the same problems no matter how much I tried. 

Also, this was the first time I had to work and that's how a new story of symptoms emerged.

In the time I was working, I was in the worst time of my physical and cognitive abilities. I would costantly forget about tasks, couldn't multitask and had issues talking as I had a hard time finding simple words. I don't know if the routine or the fact that I started drinking coffee helped a bit with my productivity. Parallel to that, when standing for longer than two hours and doing active tasks with my hands, I experienced, the same pain in the feet, but now also pain in the knees, hips, lower back, upper back, shoulder blades, shoulders and neck. All of this pains were eased with bone cracking and stretching except for the shoulder blades which was some tingling burning sharp pain in the middle of the upper back that would spread to my lower shoulder blades specially when trying to stand with my back straight as well as the usual feet pain which will just continue throughout the day and bother me for the afternoons and sleep. 

I also would always have trouble sleeping still and became used to stretch and move constantly as staying still will make me feel pain and discomfort. I'm sure this definitely affected the quality of my sleep as I would never wake up in the same position and I would feel tired and sleepy during the day.

After all this happened is where I began caring and trying different things to improve my physical and mental health:

- Exercise
- Yoga
- Sleeping 8-9 hours every night
- Daily Agenda
- Meditation
- Anti-inflammatory diet
- Elimination Diet
- Calorie Tracking
- HIIT Training
- Supplements/Nootropics (Vitamin D, Fish Oil and Glucosamine helped the most) I'm still taking them nowadays except for fish oil.

After trying all of this my cognition and physical health improved slightly but I didn't find the issue or something reliable.

That's when I seeked professional help and first saw an osteopath and I don't think it helped much, then I booked myself for a sleep study to discard sleep apnea and they didn't find anything unusual even though I only slept 2-3 hours and obviously didn't move because the sheets were tight and I was attached to a lot of cables.

The specialist who assessed me said that I might be depressed which was strange to me because I don't normally experience sadness due to my faulty memory. He decided to start Mirtazapine. 

The next 2 months were awful, long story short, I felt like a living zombie without emotions and sleepy all the time.

The only interesting thing was that my dreams were more vivid and since I normally dream about being in school or back home I was able to recall things I never knew I had experienced.

After that, he said he couldn't help me anymore changed me to effexor and said I should look for a psychiatrist.

I must point out that in the transition process, I tried Curcumin and it literally took all my pain away. Sadly, since I kept taking antidepressants I started feeling weird once the Effexor started to build up so I stopped taking Curcumin.

Effexor was and has been great, my memory began improving, words became easier to recall , I felt a bigger drive to do things but I was still having issues with mentally engaging tasks.

When I finally saw a psychiatrist he said indeed I might have depression and that all the symptoms associated from my cognition may be ADD. So he prescribed Dextroamphetamine on top of the Effexor.

Dextroamphetamine has had the most positive effect of anything I've tried before. Sharp focus, fast processing, euphoria, makes me very productive and gives me energy to carry with my daily activities. I had never been able to sit all day doing something mentally challenging. 

Ever since then, my quality of life improved significantly, I was outperforming in college, began programming constantly and developed some applications, started learning about different academical areas, started a business, etc. 

The reason of why I've talked about my mental symptoms is just to have a better context of my pathologies. I have a theory that I may suffer from some kind of inflammation that affects not only the body but also the brain. 

Now, even though I feel relatively well and my physical symptoms are sort of tolerable with constant exercise. I want to know what's wrong with me and hopefully I can keep improving from there.

Metaphorical new:

Just when I was on my peak performance. I realised there was a bug in my mind. This bug would not make sense but it resonated with all the experiences I had.

Went a bit insane for 3 weeks, finally figured it out, I was not happy while having this bug sting me all over again. Something had to be done. Kept my head up, my intentions good and high. Can’t complain. I’m so happy the world is heading towards environmentally friendly approaches. Me? I’m still trying but that doesn’t take what I ought to be. A nice person.",1
"I looked back and saw my past self, an aspiring musician who's alsways passionate to play music, spends hours sitting at the piano. To me, anywhere with a piano is a heaven. I also draw, I use to draw endlessly, I used to only have a regular 2b pencil and a shitty eraser (Assuming if I could even find one to use). I draw on anything, anything that I can find. Ideas and inspiration, and energy is infinite. I never stopped, I am always competitive, I find a sense of achievement in everything and was very satisfied with everything.

That changed now, in 2021. I barely can get myself to practice my instruments, not even that my instruments are broken. My skills has noticably deteriorated and my brain always seem to fail whenever I try to do music theory. Though I am trying to write music myself now. With drawing, I rarely draw, only occasionally. However I have never been really satisfied with my artwork now and I always find myself being extremely harsh towards my production. I seem to find flaws in everything nowadays and that bothers me to no end.

Though nowadays I spend hours induldged in Minecraft, for one simple reason - I can create my own world that I desire, a world where I have control in everything and seeing things go well in there makes me happy. I developed my own city, formed my own government, create my own history and built a fictional world with endless possibilities. I wished my government was really that good in real life. Unfortunately our govenment sucks dick honestly.

I kinda feel guilty for being addicted to video games again, since when I started playing piano, it helped me quit my uncontrollable PUBG addiction, and I was proud of that. Now it feels like the vicious cycle has repeated itself. If any of you are interested in seeing what I've made I'm more than looking forward to share. I still want to go to uni, I'm jealous of my friends who during these times has achieved more than me, had their own lives, and I always had this constant anxiety that they will eventually lose interest in me and forget me. I know I have definitely displeased them with my endless annoyance and questions, fighting depression, anxiety and ADHD is like fighting a war, against yourself. You are your worst enemy, and I wished I had the courage to straight up kill myself, but I am embarassingly unmanly and I am known to everyone as ""weak"" and ""girly"". I wish I can escape everything and pretended that nothing happened anyways. I am atheist and I don't believe in Heaven or Hell, I just die and I don't exist, an infinite sleep.",1
"Hi,
Im 23, single, finished the university and working.

My whole life right now is just 1.go to work, feel anxiety for the whole day (although the work is fun so I dont know whats up with that) 2.cook and clean at home 3.repeat

All my friends are couples that cant seem to find time to hang out and everyday I just sit alone in my apartment I feel really shitty.

Every period of my life when I was feeling like this I was ok because I thought it will be better one day but now I just dont know what to look forward to. Everytime I write to my friends and propose something fun to do and they say they dont have time I feel like absolute s*** and cant get myself to do anything for the rest of the day..

He sleeps all day then waits for me to come home and says “what’s for tea I feel sick?” ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS you are home ALL day yet just try to sleep until I come home then complain at me because your blood sugar is low? -He has erectile dysfunction so I ain’t even getting sex. -He complains about EVERYTHING adverts on telly, the game I’m playing, the noises from outside, programmes we are watching, the fact he lost something he put down,when he trips over something he put on the floor… -He never cooks, that is of course the women’s job. I fucking HATE cooking. I can’t be bothered after work, and my job requires home work too. I’m sick of crying. It’s been everyday for months. Now he’s come down from bed and is now asleep on the sofa which he knows I hate, it makes me feel trapped and lonely when someone is sleeping on the sofa, fuck off back to bed, please give me some time alone.

"Just turned 18, all of my friends are gone completely now. My girlfriend of 2 years is gone. My family is completely breaking apart. I’m just alone now, I have no clue what to do. 

It’s crazy, 2 weeks ago I had all my friends and my girlfriend and I were happy. I was still getting things explained to me. Now I’m 18, completely alone except for my mom. What the fuck do I do now? Do I go to college? What am I going to do there? 

I have a job. Don’t know any people there and it’s making my depression worse. I don’t need money. I have so many problems but I don’t even know what they are or how to fix them. How do I meet people? How do I get better?

I don’t even want to tell anybody about my depression because it would make me mom feel horrible and guilty. It’s not her fault, it’s my own somehow. I just want everyone to be happy.

I never thought I would get depression or rant about it but here I am. I don’t think I would ever kill myself but I said the same thing about me getting depression. 

3 weeks ago I was a kid getting taught life skills still, now I’m a fully grown adult who is expected to know literally everything. I know nobody will read this but I just needed to rant. Thanks.",1

"I guess I’m feeling worse these days and I’m lacking an interest in everything and sleeping for ages and been skipping-school, I’m either under eating or overeating and it’s never healthy food but I just don’t care anymore . I feel bad these days because some of my friends have depression and have been sort of diagnosed , even my mum has depression and I feel like I’m exaggerating or just being selfish because I have things better than they do , I feel like I don’t have a reason to feel like this.I went to the gp a few months ago and basically she said i have signs of depression but its not serious enough to be referred to someone. My parents constantly say I’m shy but it feels way more than shyness, I can barley speak at school and my friends order my food for me because I struggle to speak. Recently I’ve been really panicky and I’m pretty sure I’ve had a few panic attacks.recently I was given a letter saying to sign up to some group therapy thing around where I live , it runs out soon and I’m too scared to do it, this isn’t the first time I’ve not done something due to anxiety . I actually applied to a college but I freaked out so much when they wanted to call I ended up ignoring it so I had to stay at a school I hate. I don’t feel like I can tell my mum this because she likes to gossip, my siblings have autism and she constantly tells other people about every little detail , even if they’re not family. When I told my mum I felt depressed i asked her not to tell everyone because she always makes our lives spectacles for everyone else. She told people, so I just say I’m fine now so she won’t tell people. My dad I guess thinks mental health isn’t that bad, I mean because my mums depression got worse the house stayed a mess and she couldn’t cook so they ended up fighting and he left for weeks. So I don’t really want to talk to him , like he saw my friends cuts and pointed it out in front of everyone… I just wanted to vent.",1
"23F. Just started uni this year and finished my first semester exams. My mental health has just been the worst to the point of suicidal ideation. Tried the free therapy uni offers and it turned out to be useless. On top of it all, I've done really bad in all my exams and will most probably end up with the worst score in class. That absolutely fucked up whatever self worth I've had for myself and was like the final nail on my coffin.. I've distanced myself from literally everyone because it...just feels strangely overwhelming to put on an okay persona. I've tried to talk to my friends and family to the point I feel like I'm perceived as a negative person to be around with. So I've stopped that.and I can't drop out at this point due to some reason. Everything is overwhelming me and I don't want to stay awake. I know this sounds very incoherent. I'd really like it if someone with similar experience can kinda talk to me about this. And I'm also down for long term friendships. 

Excuse the really bad grammar. My head is not straight.

I don’t know why it’s so hard today. I cant get out of bed today. I’m so upset today. It feels like I can’t just shake it off, I think I’m really suffering. I feel like I’m living just to continue to hurt and disappoint myself. I truly do not see a point anymore. Reddit is all I have to talk too. Thanks for listening. Hoping the day will get better.

"I have major depressive disorder &amp; started 150 mg of Wellbutrin January 1st of this year. Since starting my med I haven’t had any depressive episodes. I’m talking about the episodes that last for days where everything feels dark &amp; hopeless. I do still have my feelings of loneliness &amp; isolation sometimes but I never seem to sink all the way down like I did pre-Wellbutrin. 

However, I’m starting think that I’m experiencing emotional blunting. While I’m not experiencing intense sadness anymore, I also can’t remember the last time I felt intense happiness either. Like, I feel happy, sad, angry, etc… but all of my emotions seem to exist on the same scale. I feel pretty deadpan most of the time. On the rare occasion I do feel intense emotion, it fizzles out pretty quickly. 

For example, I got married a month ago. I love my wife &amp; marrying her made me happy. She is my greatest treasure, but if going through that day with a straight face was socially acceptable, I would have. Due to my MDD &amp; ADHD, I’m a pro at masking &amp; mirroring. I can do it on autopilot at this point. 

My wife keeps telling me that she doesn’t think I’m happy, that I don’t LOOK happy. I keep saying that I FEEL happy but when I think about it, she’s right. I know I don’t look happy. 

So I guess what I’m looking for here is anyone with experience with emotional blunting while on antidepressants. Even better if you have experience while on Wellbutrin. 

I’m considering weening myself off my meds so thanks in advance.",1

"It gets pitch black here by 5pm, so I work from 9-5 and then boom it's already dark.

I have struggled severely with depression and SAD for my whole life, and it runs in my family. The winters are unbearable here but I can't afford to move away/ wouldn't want to as my family lives here. This winter is just kicking my ass already.

It's like I work and then the day is over, it's fucking miserable. It's been making me turn back to drinking and I don't want to fall back into the habits I was in in the summer.

I'm not sure what my point of posting was... I guess I feel a little lonely and I'm just wondering what other people do to deal with the super early darkness.

Either that or they don't care. 

And not just that, but recently I haven't been able to recognize the people I know. I saw my mom updated her profile picture on Facebook and made a sudden realization, I don't know what she looks like. I'm going to be staying at my dad's for a few months but I saw my mom just 3 days ago. After that, I realized I didn't recognize my ex, my close friends, or my siblings.

"Iam new to reddit and this is my first post. It will be very long post but bear with me. I have imagined me saying everything written here to everyone i know but it is impossible for me to do it irl. As i imagine it, it just makes me tear up and shaky and i cant be doing that. I just want all this off my chest and know that someone knows how i feel so bear with me...
I wish i could just disappear (preferably in my sleep).... No need to worry i know i will never be able to end it myslef :). (99.99% of me knows this). This just makes me sad because i really dont know what is wrong with me for me to feel like this. I think it would be easier if i tell you as much about me as possible to understand easier. I just recently graduated from university in the UK and started a full time job for the last 8 months. I work 9-5 and have about 2-3 hrs to myself each day. It is not my career job.
So last week i was eating dinner an this thought of what is wrong with me wouldnt leave my mind. I sat there eating and thinking what is wrong with me. Before i knew it i was just crying for about 20 mins straight. I was sad ofcourse but i didnt know why. I had not cried since i was probly 16 so this was weird. Luckily my family already went to bed so it was alright. I know from this some would say you should t be worried if your family was there. But a thing about me is i dont show my sadness to anyone at all. And i dont plan to either so dont give that as advice please :)
Another thing is due to covid my 2 years of the 3 were wasted in my uni accommodation. Wasted in the sense i couldnt socialise and make new friends. I only have 2 friend groups but those groups are my family for life as i know them for over 10 years. However at university i couldnt make a new group that would be long term at all. I have ""friends"" from uni for sure but they are not long term i feel. The highlight of those years was that i enjoyed living alone at my own pace, smoking weed and vibing with myself. It was truly amazing. But now i do realize i dont have any new friends and it eats away at me. My workplace is full of old ppl so that will not work. I go clubs every now and then but i dont know how i feel about it to be honest. And im not a big fan of dating apps either. So how do i meet ppl? Iam confident enuf to talk and make friend seasy but where to find ? Also it might be because my standards for friends are so high becaus of my existing friend groups. Idk :/
Also, i met this girl i liked couple months ago while i was out with my friends got her number had really good convos for a while through text. Then all of sudden she gives brick wall answers eg nothing , no , no,no.... Normally it was ""nothing what about u? ""
So i could tell she lost interest and we stopped mssging. It hurt a bit for a while but i just feel maybe it was my fault she stopped her interest.And she was also the prettiest girl i had ever seen so iam also worried i wont find a gorl that attractive again. But honestly iam slowly getting over it. Or will i even find a girl that likes me as much as i like them. Also work life is draining me. It pains me to think this is what life is. Work sleep die. Sure there are fun times in between but is it really worth it. Sure the paycheck makes me happy every month but i wish life was easier. U can say iam lazy but i dont enjoy this 9-5 life. It scares me that this is what life is like for 45 years (66retirement age). Do I really have to feel so drained for that long. In my mind it really isnt worth it. I walk to work and i wish a car would just hit me so i can just have to do nothing and worry about nothing. My work isnt even hard and people at the conpany are all nice and i get paid good amount. Even with all these good things i still wish i didnt have any of it so why am i so selfish and bad?
Speaking of worrying, i do feel i have anxiety. I overthink a lot especially when i talk to people i dont know really well. Due to something that happened in the past where i offended a friends friend really bad completely by accident. It was more of a misinterpretation. But i remember how sad i made that person so even now i worry whenever i say things that they might take it the wrong way. Its ok tho now i dont even care. iam just a bad person sometimes but i was much worse in my teens. I would like to say iam a kind perosn now. Now i feel honest is the easiest and was kind of inspired by the mindset of mike tyson now. The honesty and kindness. Nowadays i feel people are somewhat fake initially and they only let you know the real them after a while . But i dont know if iam weird but to me it is easier to just be the real me from the start. But i dont know. I just dont know what is right. What is an ok way to feel. I just dont know. Like, i have things which iam grateful for but i just feel i dont deserve any of it because i wouldnt wish to die if i really was grateful. I realise the past couple paragraph is so unclear :/ but i just cant find the words to describe my thought process. These are some of the things that i think make me feel this way. But iam worried this wishing of disappearing insted of looking forward to the day will ever go away. And i just hate the thought of asking myself what is wrong with me. But i dont knkw how to stop asking it.",1

"Me and my ex-girlfriend broke up 5 months ago after 5 years of dating. The relationship ended due to my mistreatment of her. Prior to and during my relationship i struggled with depression and other things, from being molested when I was younger by a immediate-family member. This caused me to be closed off, disconnected, and often defensive. Which in turn meant i was inattentive, careless, and not the person I should have been towards my ex. She supported me for years while i had inconsistent work ethic. She was there for me and became my bestfriend and understood me even when i felt misunderstood. Truly the most amazing person I've ever met.

"Hi, I’m looking for some advice with communicating to those around me that I’m having a hard day. I try to be direct and tell them what I need (i.e. “I would like to video call you today”) but often this doesn’t portray the message that I mean which is more like “I am feeling very sad and having a really hard day. I need you to video chat me soon please.” A lot of times I just can’t say this, it is too overwhelming for me. I was thinking maybe I could come up with a code or something but that seems childish.

And I know he's trying to help me by saying that but all I felt was more desperation and hopelessness.

It took me a few hours to calm myself down, I couldn't sleep. So I just asked him to avoid talking about that in the future if it's possible. He answered with ""No. If you're not happy about it change or stop talking to me.""

I have no reason to feel this way either. School has always come easy to me and I could probably be successful if I had the motivation to get out of bed. My parents are the most loving people you could imagine, yet I have done nothing but disappoint them for the last 3 years or so. My dad grew up in poverty but is now a wealthy man, and he offered to fully pay for my college education in the future. I would likely fail and I don't want to disappoint him once again, so I'm probably taking a gap year next year. What happened to the kid, that was passionate about becoming a forensic psychiatrist?

I can't imagine a single person who's quality of life wouldn't increase if I just hung myself. Every day is an enormous task and I don't think I can do it anymore.",1
"I am in my late 20s now and I have been in treatment since I am 19. I had therapy, visited the day clinic two times and did various offers like work therapy, yoga, badminton, and so on. I tried and I fought so hard for so many years. But the last few months felt like they are taking away my whole will to live. My mother has emotionally abused me since early childhood. I decided to finally cut contacts with her when I was 19. This helped me a lot to finally be able to live my own life &amp; find out who I am and what I want and need. My dad on the other hand is sometimes there for me. But my stepmother makes sure that even if I see him only once a year - I don't even get five minutes alone with him. It feels like she took away that little bit of family that I had left with my dad. I did so well during my treatment. I started to move on with life. Two years ago I even managed to start working again out of my own will. I started with 15 hours a week and moved up to 20 hours. It was extremly exhausting to me. I was happy that I was finally strong enough to achieve something. But this took a huge toll on me. It got to a point where I started to question myself if it is easier to kill myself instead of going to work. I had that inner fight every night until the morning. On my 2nd actual attempt I kept my promise to call an emergency hotline. Since then I am 'ill' again. I am not able to work and I feel extremly empty. First I tried to keep a good shedule every day. Waking up early. Taking time to make myself a good breakfast. Doing some sport &amp; housework stuff. Going to my therapy (weekly) &amp; to my doctor (bi-weekly). I wanted to keep at it so that I can maybe start working again some day. But there is just no more progression. I usually cry myself to sleep (quietly) because I don't want to wake my boyfriend. I can't find a reason to keep going. Everything would feel easier if I could just end it. Only thing that keeps me here is my boyfriend. He does not deserve to be sad.
&amp;#x200B;
But honestly... I think he would be better off without me.
I try to hide it most of the time but I am sure he feels it that I am very depressed everyday.
On top of that I can't provide any money to our life. My therapist tells me housework &amp; taking care of the food is enough but I don't feel that way. I feel extremly useless. I feel like I am holding him back in achieving more in his life.
&amp;#x200B;
To top it off - my therapist that has helped me for over 5 years now had to cancel me. She started working at a day clinic one year ago &amp; now she needs to take in more clients from the day clinic and cancel all of her other clients. At first I thought that it is fine &amp; I will be able to find someone else.
But it will take years to get to a point where I am now with my therapist.
I am just tired of life.

Nothing really gives me motivation or happiness anymore. Usually playing some of my favourite games as a diversion helped a bit to put my mind to another world at least for some time. Now I did not even start one game for weeks. I don't see joy in them. The hope of adopting a dog in the future was like a small glimpse of happiness to me. I thought having a little companion throughout the day &amp; taking my time to teach and show this dog the world would maybe fill my own emptiness &amp; fill up my daily shedule. It would also keep the bad thoughts away since I have someone that depends on me beeing there. It sounds logical but deep down I don't feel anything happy anymore inside. And I don't want to burden an innocent animal. If you know something - or you are going through something similar please share your thoughts. Maybe it helps. At least at the day clinic the group discussions/getting views &amp; opinions from others and seeing how they deal with their problems helped me a lot.",1
"my mindset has always been to be kind of distant and not be overly affectionate. if i am then they'll know i like them- then that'll lead to them leaving me and i'll be alone feeling stupid. 

ive been playing the victim card my entire life with my friends and relationships because i have never intentionally left anyone, they have always left me. im always thinking that i'll get left behind so i dont have a lot of friends because i'm scared of that. now im with someone and i literally told him this the first week of us knowing each other. right after i said it, i wanted to actually unalive myself. he knows my true feelings and my fears and i couldn't let that happen and so when it did i just wanted to be gone. disappear.

since it was a literal WEEK since we knew each other, i knew he would leave because like jfc i just trauma dumped on the motherfucker out of nowhere. he didnt though- he said the things that i've always wanted someone to say to me. because of this underlying problem i have inside of me that expects everything and everyone to leave (that i just found out i had when i met him), its ruining us. we're both 17 and because of that, im not expecting us to last. i cant see a future for myself (like at all), and picturing life outside of high school doesnt seem real. i dont even feel ill be alive for that. he wants me in his future and that makes me so fucking happy. but because of the way i am, im hurting him so bad. 

yesterday he planned a date for us and i ruined everything. he was telling me how much i hurt him by not respecting his boundaries and acting like a child WHILE CRYING. he was crying. i keep doing these kinds of things to him. im not treating him like a human with emotions and i hate myself for doing that. he was diagnosed with depression 2 years ago and he said he finally got the OK to leave therapy because his mental state was so much better, than i came into his life. im too chaotic for him and hes been trying to understand me and the way that i am because he's trying to be the best boyfriend for me. 

we have problems weekly and we talk about them right when we notice they're there, and we don't interrupt each other and just listen. he has every reason to break up with me. im a terrible person for him. i fuck things up and i tell him how sorry i am, and he tells me that its okay and its just another bump in the road and he loves me and nothing i do will change that. i dont think i deserve that. im hurting the one person i love the most and god i fucking hate myself for that. 

i think i should get a therapist instead of ranting to strangers on subreddits. hes the 2nd person who knows what goes inside my head and my thoughts are starting to suffocate me and i feel like im going to break apart soon and thinking about asking my parents for help is terrifying because then theyll know my true feelings- that im not doing okay. its 4am and i have school in 2 hours and i haven't done any hw so i might go in the bathroom and cry about how much i hate myself then put on a fake smile and act like im having the greatest day &lt;3 hope all of u have good days today",1

I have a question. Does anyone here have experiences with nortriptyline/nortrilen? I can't find a lot of experiences online and the posts I found on this subreddit weren't too helpful. I hope someone sees this. 

I've been on Zoloft, Effexor and escitalopram before. Effexor made me horribly depressed, escitalopram helped with my mood but it seemed to worsen my anxiety. Zoloft didn't really do anything. 

My psychiatrist thinks this will help better than the aforementioned medications, but I'm pretty scared to switch (it's my own decision but I'm still nervous). 

Thanks in advance. :-)",1

We’re all going to die. It’s just a matter of how, when and why. The only thing I have left is when… fuck I need to cry. 😂😂😂I’m fuckin… just not okay. I can’t even cry anyways.

I’m fucking drowning in this suffering, and I know some would say “quit your job” okay then what? Get a New one to be unhappier at? Find some friends? And what? Be disappointed or betrayed when they show they’re true colors? Go out more? And do what exactly? What? As appealing as sitting in the park on a bench sounds… I know I’ll just end up crying.

"Not sure why I'm writing this but at this point why not.

I don't remember when I was last happy in life, since my early teens I've thought about suicide a lot. In my later teens, I had to become a full-time carer for my mother as she slipped into her deep depression and psychosis resulting in more than a few attempts on her own life. This all started after a bitter divorce from my father who quickly made it clear that he was done with us and started a new life with a new family. 

Late teens and early 20s when I should've been developing social skills and starting a life with all my peers I was living with a mentally ill woman who was mentally abusive while trying to keep her safe, by the time she became more stable I was in my mid-20s and had to enter the job market to provide for the both of us, starting to work with others it became very apparent how socially maladjusted I am and how impossible it is for me to connect with other people, either they want nothing to do with me or pretty quickly want nothing to do with me once they get to know me.

Mid 20's to my now early 30's I have no real relationships with people, I've had two people in my life who I've loved, one left without ever giving a reason and I tried to stay friends but ultimately over time I've just become a burden and a part of their life they've needed to leave behind, the other gave me the few moments of ecstatic happiness and hope I've had but it was all built on compulsive lies and in hindsight, all they wanted from me was my attention they didn't care about me or truly want me, which I fell for hook link and sinker like a fucking idiot.

Work-wise I have nothing going for me, I'm barely keeping myself a lot financially, just paying my debts but never getting ahead, and not working towards ever having a home of my own or any security. I've also been signed off work by my doctor for a total of four months this year and I don't know how to keep going so it feels likely I'll lose my job at some point and then homelessness follows I suppose.

I've tried treatments from my doctor and private therapists, the medication from my doctor just dulls my mind, leaving me in the same position as always but numb, Private therapy I've tried twice, the first time I was scammed to put it gently and the second was helpful but ultimately I can't afford it.

So there we go, 31 years struggling through in an attempt to find some happiness and it all amounts to sitting alone wishing I didn't wake up this morning and writing a pointless post on Reddit in an attempt to distract myself from thinking about suicide constantly. 

At some point it's got to be kinder to just not wake up and I don't want to wait to see how bad things will get before then.",1

"how do I help my bf (21m) ??

My boyfriend has struggled with ADHD all his life and after excessive use of marijuana he found himself in a pit of depression and anxiety with severe dissociative states. I was very worried about his physical safety and and after some reflection sought out a conversation with his parents but they haven’t been as helpful as I had hoped. 

He’s on temporary meds that have helped a little, and he’s trying to find a therapist but no one seems to be taking clients and he’s started giving up. 

He expressed to me his frustration that I haven’t been as much of an advocate as he needs me to be. He’s a very physical person and we have a long distance relationship (I live about an hour away) but I do my best to drive and see him as much as I can between school and work. He comes to see me as much as he can as well. 

I’ve come to this board because I don’t know what else to do to help him. I help him with anything he asks me to, including chores, which I’m more than ok doing. I’ve sent him therapists to look into (he’s very picky) and I reassure him as best as I can but words only go so far. I feel like I have to DO something other than what I’m doing. 

Any suggestions are welcome, thank you for reading and having your support❤️",1

I have tried to suicide but I lack the courage to actually suicide. my family sucks too. I don't know what to do with my life at this point. every day I wish my family dies (they are awful I only like 1 person in my family of 7) so people would actually give a shit about me. pathetic right?..... my family says I am just wasting away my life that is true but i just can't help it, if you know what i mean..... anyway I just wanted to write what I felt in this post so you can just ignore this.",1

The stress burnt me out and set me down a path of indecisiveness. I know I can do it, to change schools and be happy, but that creeping fear and dread, the feeling as if for some reason this change spits in the face of my life for the past 5ish years of my life.

"If I die and find out that there's no God, I'll laugh - because I've always suspected that God doesn't exist. I've used my religion like a drug over the years. Every time I take a hit I feel better for just a little while. How does that work? Well, I use it to regularly fool myself into thinking that things will get better. (And eventually they always do, but of course they always become shitty again.)
As Christians we're lead to believe that everything happens for a reason and that God has a plan for us. Sometimes when I feel low, my faith makes me believe that there will be a better day, and so I wearily go on, telling myself that my low feelings are only temporary and that God has better days in store for me.
Maybe God's not real. Maybe it's all a big lie. *But when you have depression, it's incredibly useful to have something that makes you believe that better days are in store and your misery is only temporary.* Even if it's blind faith, its one of the things that keep me going, until it won't anymore.",1

"To begin with, I (F/27) have two chronic diseases. always get told I’m a loser like “hey at least it’s not cancer” (you know people saying this are not well aware cancer patients wouldn’t wanna be compared to in this kinda fashion. so this is rude af). My first diagnosis will have been 3 years next March which had been pretty manageable and didn’t really bother me much physically and emotionally. But alas…around June this year, God plays some tricks with me again that I got another chronic disease which is quite debilitating. This is the time I started feeling detached from my family and friends. Our relationship has changed (I can feel it in the air, so palpable). Been in and out the hospital until I get nauseous every time I drive by any hospital. 

Recently I kinda avoid looking at my old pics on the wall in my house or even old facebook pics. Those include my childhood/teenage/college and graduation day pics with family members which at that time my aunt was still alive (she passed away last year. another traumatic event of mine). If I just happen to accidentally see those, I can’t help thinking how simple my life used to be. Sometimes I forget who that person is. 

I went to see a psychiatrist back in 2017 for anxiety treatment. It was successful. But this time I don’t feel like going back to him and talk about at all as my head is perpetually like a blank space. Don’t know what to discuss or something like that. Getting hold of my physical health is tiring enough. I really hate going to get any medical or psychiatric treatment by now.

Sorry for a long rant 🙏🏻",1
"I’m really hard on myself, and its similarly difficult for me to admit that. I was fortunate enough to be born to Canadian parents in 1997. I was born with TGA(Transposition of the great arteries, a serious but rare heart defect present at birth, in which the two main arteries leaving the heart are reversed). So basically from the day I was born to the ninth day of my life (day of the surgery) I was hooked up to a ton of medical equipment. Even after the surgery I had a heart murmur for life. At 15 I caught a virus, had a cardiac arrest inside of a walmart, and the medical team that revived me also hit a nerve while inserting a needle into my leg, giving me drop-foot (I can walk normally using an orthotic).
While in hospital my vocal chords were paralyzed from being intubated. I got surgery to fix that after a month or so. Two years after my heart transplant I developed an autoimmune disease called behcets disease. Its really shitty, look it up.
I also have adhd and can’t be put on medication due to my other conditions.
Looking back, maybe I am an idiot, at 21 I decided to become a practical nurse (2 year program). Now I’m burnt out, depressed, I inconsistently go to work, I’m anemic and my spleen is enlarged.

I have the opportunity to do a traineeship in accounting as well as go to uni for it. I know I won’t enjoy it, but my parents say I need to do something and I also know that as well, however, I don’t want to go into debt for something I don’t like and also I don’t want to burden or rely at all on my parents. I also feel that I won’t do well in uni because I have no passion. It’s hard. I don’t know how to tell them or if I should about my mental state. I just want to see someone for help, but I’m too insecure to do it. This doesn’t really explain it well, but every day it seems like killing myself is becoming a much better option. I’ve had thoughts before, and always try to be rational, thinking about the impacts that would have. It’s just getting more tempting, like it would be better for everyone is I just disappeared.

My relationship is a roller coaster that’s destroying me financially and emotionally, I can’t focus at work because all I can think about is how much I hate myself and think about different ways of dying. I find no joy in my life, no purpose in my work and all the dreams I’ve wanted to pursue feel impossible. I haven’t had a restful night’s sleep in a long time. I want to live but I can’t keep living my life. I don’t know what to do anymore. I just want to go to sleep and not wake up",1
"On Saturday I was bitten by a dog for defending my dog, got three vaccines because of the bit ( hate needles) yesterday a drug addict tried to hit me and rob me, I made a Facebook post asking for help for moving from the neighborhood I'm living rn and got a lot of fans of said zone insulting me and defending the neighborhood.
Have in mind I've been experienced a lot of crappy moments before and I've collecting shit for a few years now + the traumatic death of several pet rats (tumors, pneumonia, not waking up from anesthesia)
I feel trapped there and want to move out but the few places that are available for rent are either crazy expensive or don't allow pets and without my dog, there's no way I'm moving out, I sink with my ship. I also feel trapped in my life
I'm stressed, depressed(clinical depressed), and overwhelmed, have no friends or family to support me, trapped with a narcissistic parent and although I'm 19 have 0 independence.
Just need a few people to send memes or positive messages tbh, I can't keep up with this
sorry for any grammar mistakes, not native english speaker and quite nervous at the moment",1
"A few months ago I did something really stupid and felt guilty so I told my best friend. We had been best friends for about a year and close friends for 3 or 4. I wanted to go back and undo what I did but I also felt like I had to tell her. She said she needed time and space and that I couldn't be around her. I understood this and felt like it was even being generous.

After around a month or so she texted me and said she wanted to be friends again but with strict boundaries. I obviously said yes and that I would do everything possible to never do anything like this again. We didnt really talk at all and only texted small talk occasionally.

Its been about 5 months now and we've had more talks and it no longer feels like talking to a stranger. This being said it still feels like an acquaintance rather than friend. She is my only close friend and I care about her so much I am constantly worried that Im bothering her or making her life worse by being a reminder to what happened.

It was a situation where it was 100% my fault there was no shared blame and I hate myself for what I did. Hurting her was the worst thing Ive ever done. Even though we've come along way I still hate myself everytime I think about it because I know I've caused so much pain to someone already going through so much. I dont think I will ever not hate myself for what I've done.",1

I just do the same routine everyday and never feel good. my friends at school don't like me and I'm pretty sure I jave really bad social anxiety. whenever I talk to my mum she just says ""oh it's normal for your age"" or ""yeah I understand it sucks but it's not that bad like you don't have depression or anything.

"(29M) My wife (29F) suffers from Dysthymia. She watched her cousin drown in front of her when she was a child. She had a neglecting father and her mother passed away while she was in her teen years. Her only sister she felt close with died from covid last Summer.
I’ve been unhappy with the relationship for about 4 years but I always get the feeling that things will get better. She actually has made big improvements on her drinking problem that she used to have. However, the relationship itself has taken a toll on my own mental health. I have more anxiety than I used to have but it may be due to medications/life events other than my marriage. We’ve been together for about 8 years and married for 1 year. I wasn’t ready for marriage but she’s been using money for tuition as an excuse for her to not go back to school, so I married her in hopes for her to get her life on track. She was able to get her tuition paid for through my employer benefits. She ended up failing too many classes, therefore terminating her tuition assistance.
She is about to quit her bookkeeping job (because of stress) and do Uber eats- which is ok if I knew what her goals were for the future. The problem is that she doesn’t have any goals or motivation to do anything for herself. She can’t tell me any goals of Her’s and gets upset when I ask her. I have to frequently remind her to take care of herself (dental hygiene, career searching/research, exercise, nutrition, etc)and it’s just a major turn off to do so. I told her many times that I don’t want to tell her what to do. I bought her a trench coat and had it altered for her and she doesn’t wear it because she doesn’t care to buy pants to go with it. I could’ve bought pants for her too but why should I? I want her to want to take care of herself.
Part of me and my whole family are saying to leave her, but the other loving part of me is telling me to support he, stay in the relationship, and ignore my own feelings about the relationship because she’s in pain right now. She just started medicating a couple months ago and she’s been depressed most of her life. Should I consider the fact that she just started medicating and wait for change a bit longer?",1

"This whole existing thing is kind of funny. Magically, one day you're alive with no idea of how you got here and where you're going. But you're just supposed to accept it, and try to make the most of whatever this is. At the end of the day, everything just feels the same to me. I would say everything is boring, but I don't think that's true. It's just that my brain doesn't think that anything is interesting. Maybe it's all just chemistry, and I have no control over it. I don't even want to be happy. I also don't really care to end my life either. I just want to know why I am here. But I suppose we all do.",1

I don’t usually day drink, or do drugs like I have in the last two days. I just cannot bear to think about it. Nothing feels real and I’m horrified by the thought that my life will never be the same again.

It's too much. I can't go on like this. Fuck, I can't spend more time like this. I know I won't commit suicide, but I wish I could just... freeze time. Watch the world completely stop, while I have all the time in the world to figure myself out. My interests, passions, abilities, emotions - everything.

I don't understand how some people have their shit together. It's insane! I just... I feel so sad, and angry . I wish I was better. I'm going to fail my preboards. I'm skipping so much school that I'm terrified of showing my face to teachers cuz I'll be humiliated.

I only have one online friend and he's the the only friend I've got and all of my other friends I used to play with just fell out of contact with me.

My mom is basically as close you can get to crazy because she talks to herself, thinks everything is poisoned, thinks people are drugging us, hacking us, stealing from us the list goes on for miles.

My dad has a job at a weed dispensery and is gone for most of the week so I can't spend time with him.

"Hi everyone.
I was very depressed for 10 months, but I decided to quit being depressed by changing my mental thought during last month. Surprisingly, it really helped. I've started working out, eating much healthy food, and taking multi vitamins. I've also stopped vaping weed and I finally start dreaming in my sleep. However, I still have not seek ang medical help with my depression so my brain is very numb. But I don't feel like killing myself anymore.

But the worst news is... I might have become misanthrophy.
I just hate people. I hate society and I want the world to turn against me. I can't stop thinking about murdering people.
I hate it when my neighbours have loud sex. It makes me so angry that I grind my teeth too hard. I just want to grab a knife and stab them to death. Sometimes, when I take my dog out for walk, I see little children coming near me to pet my dog. I also want to kill those children. I also want to kill people who hurt other people's feeling. I want to kill criminals. I sound like hypocrite but if I do murder someone, I might as well murder myself since I am a criminal. I think about going to prison time to time. If I was in prison, I will try my best to kill the guard so I can be self confined. And I will continue to be bad so that I can be by myself forever. 
Now, keep in mind. This is all just a fantasy. It's all in mind. I would never actually do this. I know what's wrong and what's right. But I don't really care. I know that psychopaths aren't aware of this type of behaviour. But who knows. Maybe I am one of ""awakend psychopath""",1
"I was depressed but I came out of it but now I am strong still I don't know why situation becomes very critical for me that it literally breaks and torns me...

I help stray dogs not because I love them or I get very emotional but because of very fact that they literally have no body in this world to help them in their tough times and even food is not available for them

Hence I help them because I help every poor in their pain.
I know that I do very little work.

2 stray dogs in our colony were treated as wild and every one try to scares them.
But since last year I saw they were not getting food so I started to gave them food and they started to trust me but since they suffered a lot because of humans when they were small they are now become adult and don't trust humans but they do trust me but little.

And because I help everyone despite my own bad conditions I started to feed and help dogs in my area
Do their treatments and I got some experience of treating dogs ailments and wounds

3 months ago one of that poor dogs got a huge wound on back

And I started to pour antiseptic and turmeric in it but as I feared It got maggots in it in very monsoons
So
I started to run behind that dog to remove maggots and apply cream

I spent one month outside alone with dogs with one hand filled with food and other with medicines

I fought all society, stayed with her at evening, mornings and even all nights till dawn whether it was raining or not

I ram behind her, did everything like I used to give her food so that I can remove maggots and apply cream

Even people in society didn't let me in society monsoons so I stayed outside society 

Even the injured dog didn't fully trusted me but I kept doing treatment

I spent 12 hours outside home with them for 15 days

And 
I used to go in night at 2 am so that everyone would be slept and I would treat her inside building secretly and then release her before dawn

Wound was very big 

But I didn't gave up and only people helped me were my mom who gave me money , my brother who handled all house alone and also helped me every time and Universe who made all this possible and my vet who gave me cream and the man in dog food Shop 

Because of all Universe helped me 
Her wound healed completely and an infinite impossible thing became possible

And because she is an experienced dog who runs from humans neither I was able to take her to vet and my home nor Any NGO was able to help

This journey seems deep but 
I know that how it truly feels when you have to do everything to do an infinite impossible thing

I came across so many many many heart wrenching experiences in this journey
That I will try to emphasize in some lines

It was like,
""I have to treat and heal a serious COVID patient in ICU and make him normal again ALONE""."" I have to do everything for him EVERYTHING, ALONE""

I am still shaking due to this experience

And again 5 days ago I again saw a little wound with maggots started so I again started same

This time wound was very small but her co operation was even reduced

But fortunately due to god universe 
What I did to treat it came good and maggots were gone and it started to heal but now she doesn't even come close to me because she knows I would apply cream
But since
Wound is small and healing
I don't apply cream anymore just give some tablet in food 

But again a very heart wrenching moment has come

I live in this colony on rent and this entire colony is going for redevelopment and I have to leave this building in 2 months

But I am very very very very deeply scared about future of these 2 poor strays because they avoid humans and don't trust them like a street dog does because they were treated very badly

I am now very sad that how they will live in future
Because they were not treated good they don't mix up with other dogs and live alone

I am very stressed that will they get proper food?

I don't want them to be again in pain (╥﹏╥)

Already they have suffered a lot

I am deeply scared 
Because if I move out of town I won't be able to come for them every day

I deeply understand that

Being alone in cruel world, without food and water wandering every where for help is so deeply painful
All alone

I have tried to write my experience short as possible sorry if it's big but the true experience I know will get days to convey (╯︵╰,)

Thank you very very very very very much if read all of this 

And all I want you to do is pray for them and me
Only Universe has solution on this 

Please pray for us 🙏",1
"not in the traditional sense of being broken. i sometimes feel that, but thats not what i’m feeling now. i guess i feel unfixable. like, i feel like whatever problems i have are so bad, that any tips or help someone gives me to deal with them just dont work. for example, coming into college, i didnt make friends. and it’s been like that. people gave me advice, like go to events, join clubs, etc. it didnt work. nothing they suggested works. that’s just one example but there are so many more in my life. i feel kinda… trapped. trapped in the sense that i’ve exhausted all my solutions. theres nothing else and i cant do anything about my situation. its pretty crushing. does anyone else feel this?",1

"When I was eight I thought we were going on a ""visit"" to see my grandparents but turns out we got evicted. They didn't have a spare room in the house for us to move into so they had us move into a small trailer with my mom and 2 dogs. After 2 years of living through that my uncle finally evicted us after with him and my mom had countless arguments. So there was only one place to go at the moment and that was my dad's drug addict friend Mike's house. At this time my dad was doing basically every drug you can name with his friend. About 1 year of this and my mom and his friend were fighting like pissed off badgers because he has some very bad anger issues and she wasn't really helping the situation so me my mom and my dad got evicted from there too. We move into my other dad's friend Sandra's apartment for about a 2 years and in that time my dad was still using a lot of drugs. My mom has always been a bit crazy but she started to descend even more thinking she's being hacked and everything is poisoned and talking to herself. So everyone got evicted from there because the landlord didn't know we were there. We lost everything in that place and the stuff we cared about was sent over to Mike's house where my dad and him aren't in very good terms so he just kept it all and told us to go fuck ourselves. We go to a homeless shelter for about half a year and in that time my dad picked up his act and stopped doing drugs. The shelter helped us move in to a risky unsafe apartment complex with drug deals shootings and stealing happening pretty normally. My dad and Sandra are still good friends and he lived with her in her new place so I visited him from time to time. This happened for about 2 years until one of my visits took a little longer than I thought and as I suspected we got evicted again. So I stayed there for a couple weeks until we tried that shelter again and asked if we could go back in and that's where I am now. I go over to Sandra's place for wifi and to just get out of this shelter. I have thought of suicide before and attempted it. I don't want to imagine what my mom's going through.",1
"i’m new to this subreddit and i’m not sure if i can flat out say self harm or only use abbreviations, so i’m sorry if i get that wrong
ok so i’ve been depressed since like 5th grade (probably sooner but that’s the earliest i can recall that my sadness wasn’t regular sadness) and i’m 20 yrs old now. i started self harming in 6th grade and didn’t stop until 10th grade. i’ve had a few slip ups since but i haven’t done it in almost a year now. i remember when i did self harm it got really bad at one point. it almost felt like i was addicted to it bc i did it everyday. so fast forward to now, I’ve been depressed and suicide has been on my mind for about 2 months. my depression is like waves, it’s always there but some waves are bigger and longer than others. and for about 2 days i’ve thought of self harming, but i don’t know….i feel pathetic even thinking about it. when i think back to when i used to do it as a kid i’m like “lol why the fuck did you do that” so i think that’s why i feel pathetic about it now, i’m like “really dude? you’ll resort to that but won’t get help wtf” but at the same time i’m telling myself “but what if it makes you feel better like it used to, it’s not that big of a deal if you just do little ones” 
so basically my question is, if you used to self harm as a kid do you think about doing it now as an adult? if you do, what do you feel? do you feel pathetic or worthless, like you let down your child self? 
thank you in advance to those who answer :)",1

"I haven’t worked in the last year and half mostly due to the pandemic and my unexpected illness. A part of it was also because I wanted to take the time to “upgrade” my education and technical background and move away from the hospitality industry. 

But the upgrading part didn’t end up happening. I didn’t improve. Overtime, I just became more depressed, reserved, and too fearful to try, fail, and move forward. I couldn’t take myself out of that “victim” mentality. My self-esteem is at an all time low and my anxiety and depression at an all time high. 

I’ve already reached the limit to my unemployment so I can’t claim for more government support, and I’m down to my last $100. I’m lucky that I still have a roof over my head because of my parents, but I still have bills to pay (phone, transit pass, therapy, meds).

Tomorrow, I’m going to reach out to my former manager and ask if there’s an opening position at his workplace. I’ll have to go back to the hospitality industry for now until I pick myself back up.

"I don't know where to start. On September 23rd 2021 I contemplated suicide in the back of my car. I'm a 28 year old man who's been living in his car for the most part of 3 months. Why? Because my ex was an abusive alcoholic and raged at me one night in her apartment. Me being brown skinned and her being white, I was scared of the outcome if the cops were called. So I just took the beating and left without struggle. Now I'm living at a truck stop, eating out everyday. A part of me doesn't care that I sleep in my car because I've fantasized about Van lifing since I was 16. Just pictured me being prepared and not being kicked out so abruptly. Yes, I still have my job... They don't know my situation, not like they'd care, but I continue to work this job because it gives me time to play my video games for 8 hours to find some sort of peace and escape, that's been the saving grace for me. They pay only 480 a week. Recently I started visiting with my mom on my off days every week, and with her knowing my situation, she's been begging me to live with her and start over. Thing is she lives in a small town population is around 2-3k. I've worked in that city before and the jobs aren't in abundance and I don't want to commute 45 minutes to the nearest considerable job. I don't really have friends, nor a girlfriend so I feel alone almost every night. The friends I do have don't know about this. I'm depressed all the time because I feel like I should have some grip on life at 28 years old. I didn't have it extremely rough growing up, I had everything I needed or wanted. I went to college and I've worked for the state. What am I doing wrong? Am I wrong for not wanting to go back to living with my mom and finding some crappy job and start over? I just feel a sense of I'm a grown man and I can do it myself, but I'm fading guys... Fast.",1
"I am 17 years old and I’m pretty sure I have many mental issues. I was recently diagnosed with an anxiety/depression disorder as well as ADHD this late in my life, and I have tendencies that make me believe there’s more. My doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin XL 150mg for my anxiety and ADHD and I have been taking that for the past 2.5-3 weeks. This year is my last year of high school and my whole life I’ve been praised for my academic ability (I was always talkative and distracting in class so it makes sense to me that I have ADHD, but I managed up until this point) and I have always pushed myself as a result, this year I think I pushed myself too far and I have dug myself a hole so deep that I have just given up with everything. On top of that I suffer from a chronic stomach pain issue that results in me doing absolutely nothing for 3-4 days when it arises (which can happen every other week or every couple months, totally random) and this gets me down, I have seen specialists for the last 3 years but they can’t figure it out. This year I chose to take 3 AP courses as well as 3 other academic intensive courses. Slowly but surely for the past couple months I have been getting more and more homework building up, overdue essays and assignments, and falling behind on my studying. I have been a procrastinator my whole life but I have always been able to complete assignments a day before they were due and get high 90s somehow, leading to me continuing to repeat that action due to the reinforced positive outcome every time, but this year that doesn’t work. I keep getting disappointed with myself and my grades and then that results in me losing motivation and so much stress building up and the cycle repeats itself worsening every time. I smoke weed (I decided I am going to stop since I didn’t realize it was not good to smoke weed and take Wellbutrin, and it’s also bad for my anxiety I suspect) and I tend to vape since my friends all vape (which I’m also stopping because, it’s vaping…). I started both of those the start to middle of last year and I think stuff has been going down since then. I have no motivation to even attempt at trying to catch up on homework, I’m worrying about money, I’m worrying about relationships, I’m worrying whether or not my intellectual capacity has been hindered by my consumption of those drugs and whether or not that has ruined my capacity to do fucking anything. My attention span is worse than it’s ever been and I sit at my desk for hours and complete only a small amount of work. I don’t get enough sleep, I feel like I have no one to talk to and no TRUE friends just a ton of people I hang around with, and the ones that I am closest with I don’t open up to. I have consistently had periods of sadness over girls or being lonely or some shit for years but they were never as bad before the middle of last year, Grade 11, and I would always come out a stronger person but i don’t get that feeling this time, this time it’s different, it’s not about girls or friends it’s about life. I wanted to go to a school in the states my whole life but my last years grades probably won’t get me in, never mind this years, i regret so much and I wish I tried harder I wish I never started smoking and I wish I never started vaping, I feel as if I’ve ruined my life, I feel like my dreams I had as a kid won’t come true. I’m just lost. I know I have to do homework and other responsibilities but I simply just get anxious about them when I think about it and end up not doing anything. I’m afraid I’ll regret my university course selection and I’m afraid I won’t do good either, i’m afraid i won’t be successful in life or my dad will be disappointed (he’s never been one to show too much praise and is very successful so I have big shoes to fill, he also has ADHD but has never done anything about it and has gotten this far in life so i wonder if i’m just chicken shit, and wonder if he thinks that too). I don’t know why but recently I have felt uncomfortable around my friends, worried about what they’ll think about what I said, worried if they really like me, worried that they think I’m weird (I used to be extremely socially awkward when I was younger, but that went away awhile ago). I stress about what I should say and if it’s the right thing to say. I’m just so confused with everything. During lessons I struggle to understand and since I don’t sleep a lot I am dozing off for the whole lesson and end up not understanding when I go and try to do homework later since I was practically in and out of consciousness. Despite that I don’t try and go in and get help, I just struggle, I feel as if I’m trying to get someone to reach out to me without asking for help. I had a mental breakdown today because I couldn’t stop thinking about the stress of everything and the homework I didn’t get done for tomorrow. I don’t do anything I like anymore, I don’t play games often or watch youtube I just sit there on my phone, I feel like I’m just empty I’ve lost who I am. I’m not the same person I was before I went to high school, the young ambitious boy who was eager about learning, eager to see what he would become when he graduated. Well, I’m sure he’d be disappointed. Every waking moment of my life I am filled with stress and anxiety. I just don’t even know where to start or what to do, I guess we’ll see what quitting vaping and smoking does, since I decided I’ll try quitting that for 3 weeks today since I was stressing about it, and from now on treat it like alcohol, limit it to occasions. I just want to be heard I guess not sure what i’m expecting out of this, I don’t usually use reddit but I’m gonna give it a try since someone has gotta be able to give me some decent advice. I hope that all made sense to whoever is reading, and thank you as well for taking the time to read this, it comforts me to think at least someone is listening.",1

My moms's pissed as hell, I don't have any friends to talk to and therapy's been getting me nowhere. I tried to post here before but no one gave a crap and don't think it'll be any different now. So for anyone who's reading this: I don't know what to do, I just feel like everything and everyone hates me, like there's something wrong with me that makes me irredeemable to everyone. I don't know what I did to deserve this, I feel helpless, I want someone to love me and tell me it's all gonna be alright but all I get is a punch in the gut and a kick in the balls. Every time I feel like things are getting a bit better life just gives me a huge reality check right in the face and I feel even more depressed than before. All I have to distract me from the cruelty and hate of the world is playing video games or reading. My mom just took my PlayStation away and before that she yelled at me for like half an hour. I'm sick and tired of it all. I want things to be different, better, but I don't what to do about this vicious cycle of fuck-ups im in.
If you've got anything you could tell me, do it. I don't care how minor, petty or hateful it is, give it to me. Anything, please.",1
"Everyone's pretty much gone. I've either pushed them away or they stopped talking to me. I don't know how much longer I can endure, I seriously think about suicide almost everyday now. If I had to say, it's not as bad as before, but it's getting there fast. The only thing keeping me from isolating is school. But once I've graduated I really don't know what I'll do with my life. My plan is to get a job, while studying korean. Once I'm good enough to write a letter, I'll do just that and send it to her. Then, then I can die",1
"A few days ago I was drinking with some friends in their room and ended up passing out. I woke up to one of the guys there wanting to take me back to my room and I agreed because I felt like I was already done for the night. The moment he got through the door he started kissing me and taking my clothes off. I was too drunk and tired to really understand what was happening or push him off me at all but I do remembering saying no several times. I found out the next morning that when I was passed out at the party he was kissing me and putting his hand up my shirt in front of my friend. She didn’t stop it or stop him from leaving with me, she just told me the next day. I don’t even know what to do or how to feel, I just want to lay down and curl up in a ball for weeks, but I have to get up every morning and see him at work. I don’t think he even knows what he did and I don’t know how to bring it up to him. He acts like everything is fine.",1
"I am 18 years old. M. Just graduated. Living at home with my mother. I don’t have plans yet but have been working as a carpenter for a little over a year. I haven’t been feeling like myself for months now. I don’t enjoy anything really anymore, Don’t have an urge to do things I used to find fun. I feel like I’m always looking forward to something but there isn’t anything. I hardly have any friends anymore like I did in high school. I feel like an outcast. I always feel like everyone knows something I don’t about life. I can’t sleep at night unless I smoke weed or else I’ll be up all night with a head full of thoughts. I don’t know what to do.",1
"So I'm turning 25 this week. Throughout my life I've had a ton on anxiety and depression. Sometimes it's less and sometimes it's more intense but it's definitely always there. People have always told me that thing eventually get better, and I've always believed it. This is the first time in my life that I've genuinely asked myself this question.

Not to give a sob-story, but long story short, these last few months have collectively been one of the worst times of my life so I guess with that and with my birthday coming up, my mind likes to play some games with me.

Any advice? Maybe just some good vibes? I appreciate you guys. Thanks for giving this a read",1
"I have this pattern where I think if I have this thing I’ll be happy in my life, finally. First was “Oh high school is gonna be the turning point in my life!” it’s not it’s so much worse and harder, just being around people makes me exhausted. Second I thought a relationship would make me happy, just the idea of it now stresses me out. And now I’m on “When I’m finally an adult I can do so much more, college will have people I’ll clique with and I’ll be able to do what I want.” But that’s not true. No matter what it is that I’m looking forward to, I know it’s not what I make it out to be.

It truly feels like everyone around me is properly existing even if they have problems of their own, but I just sit back and watch my life play out before my eyes, like I’m ‘too’ self aware. I hate it.",1
"i'm struggling with depression, OCD and anxiety every day. my coworkers and boss don't know it. i always zone out, have a blank expression on my face and stare at the walls. idk how to look happy. when my coworker randomly said i looked ""scary"" i was ready to break down right there. i think he could tell that it hurt me when he said that because he clarified that he was joking and idk...it just made me even more sad cus he's def not joking. maybe could an experienced person give me a tip on how to fake my happiness? or make myself look Happier. i'm a girl if it helps",1
"I don’t belong here, life isn’t for me.",1
"Every moment in life I am always worried or thinking of the next thing. I am never just enjoying whats in front of me. I am always bored and hoping the next thing will bring me happiness but it never does. Even with sex. I am not sure if I have ever had an orgasm. I think I did but my first thoughts were thats disappointing. Everything I try I have that same thought. Everyone says I would know if I did. Well what if I do and thats just as ""good"" as it gets. I just feel hopeless. I feel like I'll always be unhappy and dissatisfied. Does this go away? Is this because I'm depressed? Is it temporary? I have no hobbies and absolutely nothing makes me happy. Is there more to life?",1
"What the living shit happened to me? Was I like adopted from the dumbest person alive? Did God see my ugly baby body and just said that “oh he’s a mistake, let’s make him a worthless piece of shit.” Why am I such a stupid piece of shit; A stupid pathetic piece of shit?",1
"i’m going through a weird mental change (if that’s a good way to put it) i’ve just been reflecting on my life, my choices, my actions and my relationships. and i’ve come to the conclusion that i’ve never really made a proper decision. i never sit down just think, think, think about anything and everything. consequences, the future and how my decisions impact my life even in the smallest sense. i have no clue where life is going to take me and i see the beauty in that. but somehow i feel like i’m doing too many things wrong.
maybe it’s the worry and anxiety in me that never fails to show. But the small things irk me, because i know how important they can be for anybody.
i feel like i make the right choices but i never actually think before i act, i just do and sometimes it ends up to be good or bad, but never something for certain. i’m always in my own shadow of how i think it’s all meant for and does for me. decisions like goin out on the weekdays to just enjoy time with a friend, making poor romantic relationship decisions (most notably putting myself in poor situations that will never end up good) not enjoying time with my family, not taking school and learning seriously, never planning anything out and just going with the flow. it’s detrimental to my own mental health, but at the same time i can’t find the motivation within myself to see the other side and prove to myself that maybe i am going down the right path. i keep telling myself that i’m living life correctly and making the right decisions, but deep down i know that something is off, and i can never be truly content with my own actions.
i don’t know how anyone sees me, and i know for certain that nobody sees me the way i see myself. i wish to portray myself in a positive light but nobody understands me. i can’t be me. i just can’t be me. and it consumes me to not know what to do.
i’ve slowly created a facade of myself. and it truly kills me because i know this facade isn’t who i truly am, yet i’m slowly becoming it. i’m not who i was before and i don’t know if i can ever reach that point again. i’m no longer kyle lavrisa, i’ve become what everyone expects and sees as me.
i know that it’s impossible to see the future, and to make every correct decision to lead myself down my dream path. it kills me, truly and deeply... i know that i’ll never know what to do, i’ll never be able to find resolve and content within myself. sometimes i do ponder, but that leads me to the overall holdings of life. i’ve come to realize that life is complete randomness turned up to 11. i dont understand it yet i yearn for a better understanding, im left dazed and confused
life is my own roller coaster and i’m beginning to feel like i understand myself better, life has so much to offer but i’m not grabbing onto these opportunities
i just want to have fun and accept myself to enjoy life, yet im held back by a force of everything, whether that force is my ego, my ideas, other people’s view or expectations i know i wrote a lot and a lot of it might not make sense, but i had to put my emotions into some form of words, even though that might be the hardest part for me",1
"Even since I was little, I remember taking AGES to fall asleep. Nowadays I know that I take an hour to gal asleep on good days, and 2 on normal days. This is the reason why I can’t sleep- My mind goes crazy. I’m not taking like overthinking or worrying, I’m talking like i think of every word there is and my mind just says it, every image I can think of and it all just shows up at the same time. For example: I’m trying to fall asleep and this is what my mind thinks “broccoli broccoli no no no no stickers!!!!!” It doesn’t make sense TT music doesn’t really help because I just listen to every note and pretend I’m the creators boss critiquing the music TT how do I turn off my mind when I sleep And should I ask my psychiatrist for sleeping pills?",1
"i barely get out of bed anymore , i sleep for half of the day. i need to go back to therapy, i don’t know why i thought it would be fine. i feel like cutting even tho i cut a week ago, before that i was clean for 3 months.",1
"As the title says pretty much 

I don't really care about if I pass to the next class but it makes me feel even worse cuz if I'd want to heal someday I'd have few years lost and also the more bad grades I have the more my parents blame me, so I'd like to pass even if it's not for myself

I tried to force myself to study before tests but I can't even remember most of the things if it's too boring and all 

I tried to force myself to do homework (some I can do cuz I actually like math so it ain't hard for me) but I can't do something by myself (I do it only if it's on the Internet) 

I tried to--, well, I didn't, but I really don't want to read all those setbooks cuz pretty much all of them are boring and bs 

It would be great to get better grades on my Polish lessons (I'm from Poland) for writing essays and stuff but if I don't read all these setbooks I literally can't write anything; I'm better off writing something in NOT my language because I feel more comfortable with English even tho most of it I learnt (and learn I guess) through playing video games and watching foreign youtubers

I read books (well.. I've read I think 4 books so far, reading 5th but I don't know what to read after I finish this one) but I can't write essays about them cuz you have to choose topics about setbooks 

I already skipped one of these essays and haven't even tried taking it cuz I know I wouldn't do well at all 

Polish teaching system sucks (I believe not only)",1
"I have this persistent feeling of sadness and despair. Sometimes it feels like background noise, other times it's like a dagger has been plunged into my chest.

I am a public school teacher and from what I can recall, this feeling started when I met my first class. They say that if you're going to teach, you should always be upbeat. You should always smile and have that welcoming aura for your students. I do that, but I can feel like my cheeks hurt because of the fake smile. When the kids are no longer around, the smile fades.

I don't have that self-recriminating dialogue inside my head, but I always feel like something in my life is missing, or something in my life was taken away.

I feel this cloud of boredom. I can do tasks and finish them, I am not paralyzed by what I feel. Yet, this feeling stays. There are days that I feel fine, and there are days like this one that just makes me want to post something such as this on r/depression.

I don't have a clear purpose or goal in my life other than, say, doing a hobby or finishing some work. I don't believe in so many things that people say I must do, like climbing the professional ladder or what. In my mind, they seem to me like they are deliberately ignorant of how the world (and their aspirations) are messed up.

I find it odd how people oftentimes delude themselves about what's good and true and be entirely confident about what they're doing. For example, cult leaders. They are so damn sure about everything they say, everything they do, that the world ought to burn if they're proven wrong.

I can see this same certainty with my co-teachers, utterly being sure that what they do is the right way education must go, never mind the fact that corporal punishment and grades are outdated, oftentimes destructive practices antithetical to education.

These are some of the things that run inside my head. I am skeptical about almost everything, even about my beliefs, and I think this has greatly affected my mental health.

How I wish I could just be ""normal"", like people just chilling and hanging around, discussing their favorite brand of diapers, how to pay the mortgage, and the latest office gossip.

I am not like that, though. My mind does seem to find ways to look beyond the simple facts of daily life. But I don't feel good about it. It seems to me that the world is a ridiculously complicated place to live in. I have few answers for life's tough questions and that overwhelms me. For others, the world appears easy: go to school, graduate, have a job, two and a half kids, climb the corporate ladder, retire and die.

Is this what life is all about? I don't know. I am lost.

TL;DR: I read my own post. I can sense in my own words depression and existential crisis. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe not. But the hard feelings are always there.",1
"It's 1:39 AM and I need to go to work tomorrow at 7:30am. Whenever I try to sleep, I think about her. What can I do",1
Do you have a purpose in life or a reason to live? Is there something/someone in your life that's worth sticking around for? What makes you keep going?,1
It’s not like anything about my life has gotten better it’s all still the same if not maybe a little worse. It’s not like I feel emotionally numb or anything either I still laugh and have fun sometimes when I’m at school other than that tho it’s like I don’t feel anything unless I’m distracting myself I just kinda feel empty when I’m just sitting there. It’s not like it bothers me that I don’t feel it anymore I just kinda feel out of place and I don’t know why.,1
"I've been taking depression and anxiety meds for about am year now and started to notice hair loss. Didn't think much of it at the start since I thought it's because I moved to a new place so probably the water isn't that good or new shampoo or something 

But a friend of mine who also takes depression meds said the same thing

Is this a known issue or common side effect of depression meds?",1
It’s 1:30am and all I can think about is how much I would love to walk into some traffic right now. Every day is the same but I have no will to make it different..5 years have happened since I started feeling this way.. living this way and all hope has finally vanished. If im the only person who can change my reality then im fucked because im seriously hopeless. No friends no family. Not an exaggeration. What is the fucking point? Why do we bother staying here? Because of the minuscule amount of hope that one day everything will be different? How will anything ever be different if my future relies on me solely when I can’t even get out of fucking bed. I can’t shower. I do nothing and all I want is a life worth living but can’t take the steps to do this. Im sorry just needed to get this out. Doesn’t matter if anyone replies.,1
"feel so empty and done with everything, I feel like I would be better off not being here anymore. I want to stop feeling like this forever",1
"Im 14 I have constant apathy, feeling of worthlessness, and being just plain dead inside. The only thing stopping me from committing suicide is that I don't want to die a minor. I would ask someone IRL but I have trouble talking to adults.

"I'm a 19 y/o man. My journey through this imaginary jungle called depression has been consistantly getting harder and harder as I grow up to be an independent human being. I consider myself a very self-reflective person and the last 3 years of my life I've had to dig into my unconscious mind to figure out wtf is wrong here; why do I feel like shit and why did I waste my teens being a depressed piece of dead meat. So long story short, I came to the conclusion that my hopelessness was due to the fact that I have an underlying trauma related to jobs and schools, I have a deep rooted hatred, I can't stand the fact that I have to sell my time to be able to live a normal life. I can't enjoy weekends because I know that monday's around the corner and I'll have to repeat the cycle all over again. I can't work out anymore because I'm too stressed to have even a little bit of strength in my limbs, I can't play videogames anymore because I'm too stressed to even have fun, I can't go out with friends anymore because I'm too stressed to even have a normal conversation with them, I can't watch a movie anymore because I'm too stressed to even pay attention to the story. This all relates to TIME and what I can and can't do with it, it stresses the fuck out of me that I need to sell my time, the most important asset that a human being can have. The most common suggestion that people make when I tell them how I feel is ""drop out"", but if I do that my dad will kick me out and I'll have to sell my time to cover my basic needs, If I continue my career I'll have to sell my time to get a grade, and everywhere I look at there's always a dead end that requires me to sell my time, this is the perfect checkmate that the machine has pulled on everybody. We're nothing more than human capital. At the end of the day, money is the only thing that can make this checkmate look like a joke, a simple game, but the lack of money can make this checkmate be a lifetime prison sentence. I've noticed that when I talk about this, people tend to cut me off with the classic ""it's just life dude"", but they don't really mean it, they also hate their jobs, they also hate school, they are stressed about paying their bills, some of them are hopeless and sometimes even more than me, they cut me off because they don't want to hear my critic, they don't want to be reminded that sometimes life isn't even worth it anymore, they don't want to be reminded that they don't even act like living beings anymore, they're just human capital getting up early in the morning to grow a company that they don't even care about, that is owned by a boss that they hate. And yeah, I know that this topic isn't new, many people come to the same conclusion every single day, suicide rates at ATH's, people leaving their jobs, speculative assets going on parabolic runs, the attempt of DeFi to democratize wealth, these are all symptoms of a surge in the amount of people that hate the machine and the realization that money buys time and time is by far the most important thing one could have. The only thing keeping me away from losing my shit is the work I'm putting into trying to secure my financial security and the active participation I have on this movements like DeFi that try to make the financial system a little bit more fair to all of us. I'm not a religious person, but I pray to see a future where we don't have to sell 3/4 of our life to live the other 1/4.",1
"Here I am, every single fucking day sitting in my bed trying to force myself go to school, i just can't. I got antidepressants, i got therapy, none of that works because at the end of the day I can't do anything. I can't even shave, I lack motivation for the stupidest of tasks.",1
"Hi, I have mentally checked out. Feeling numb, ashamed, waiting for the impending doom. I haven't thought of hurting myself yet but I keep thinking it's the logical progression. I have really low tolerance for pain/suffering, atleast that's what my mind has convinced me. I cannot imagine a future where I keep suffering from anxiety and depression for prolonged periods of time. Everything seems to remind me of this thought, whatever I do lol. Looking for some advice however drastic. Thanks for reading.",1

"My whole life seems to have just been a tragedy. I have zero reasons left to live.

My birth mother was a returned orphaned who never graduated middle-school. She dropped out and she was raped by some thug and I’m the product of it. She put me up for adoption.

My first memory was being in a car by myself in the middle of the night and crying scared why I was alone and sitting in my own pee.

My siblings stabbed my face and later broke my leg when was 3. I just remember their laughing at my pain. Huge smiles and laughs.

Sexual assault by my brother. My brother sexual assaulted me and my sisters. I have no memories of being happy. My mother took out all her own childhood abuse on me. Telling me about how her father had beaten her with a belt, her mom had been cruel and died of brain surgery when she was 10, and gleefully saying how her first father had hung himself in the shower and her sister had found his dead body. She’d often tell stories about children who had hurt or killed themselves and I felt like she was saying that in hopes I would.

I saw my sister prevent my mom from stabbing herself with a butcher knife. My mother would constantly tell me I was ugly and stupid and basically use me to do all of the chores around the big house. I was homeschooled and only learned from what books I could find. I foolishly did everything my parents asked of me because they raised me on religion, Mormonism and I was fearful of God. 

My siblings used to take humor in my pain from locking me out of the house and beating me up. Idk why my parents often weren’t home. When they were gone I’d hide myself in a linen closet between fabrics. One time after emerging after almost a full day in the closet, my brother had been upset and was looking bullets for the shotgun. He was in the garage and I had tried to rummage quickly through fridge while he was occupied. I heard him coming back inside and so I ran underneath the table with the family dog who was also scared. I remember him pointing the gun at me and I was scared but closed my eyes and was happy because I thought I could finally die.

Since that time. I served a mission in the Mormon church and when I went back to church school I met another RM who introduced me to a relative attending the church school and who happened to be a Bishop’s son. I met him at church. I was fearful of men but she convinced me he was a good person. He didn’t try to hold my hand until after a month of going on dates. He was the first man in my 23 years of life I let myself get close to. Well he ended up being a serial rapist and had raped his younger cousins and others. He was abusive and raped and beat the hell out of me. He’d often throw dishes and items aimed at me or close to me whenever I did something he didn’t like. When I got the courage to tell my bishop instead of caring about me he first asked how many times he “had inserted his penis” and if I had orgasmed. WTF!!!!!!!! 

Second boyfriend out of college wasn’t a Mormon and after 1.5 years I saw on his phone he had never uninstalled Tinder or dating sites.

My now husband had during the first day we were dating called and messaged his exes and other girls. Had a fake name on his socials. To this day hasn’t posted a single picture of us together besides of being hidden within an album. Never wore his wedding ring. Has held the idea of having children based on if I do enough chores for him and quit work. I found out he had been married before when we went to the courthouse and the person asked if either of us had been married. He won’t ever let me look at his phone. He gets angry when I cry cause he said something cruel and says it’s my feelings. He hates my friends. He would come into the room if I ever spoke to them and ask me to mute and angrily shout about them. So I stopped calling them and I’ve never so alone.

Most recently I went back to school and he has done everything from threaten to leave me because I was studying too much right at mid-terms because not doing enough chores or things he wants of me. This has made me fearful of not being able to pay for university and being able to live as he keeps spending money our savings our low even while I’ve pleaded with him to stop. 

Tonight I was contacted by my adoption agency about my birth mother. She was just placed in hospice. When I can home crying home from a devotional (he’s not a member) the first thing he asked was for me to go outside because he didn’t want the people that we share a wall with to hear me cry. He then marched me around the neighborhood with his only question being how he can get tickets since there’s a quarantine and telling me it’s my fault I’m upset and that it’s very bad for me to cry inside the house as well as a waste of time.

Previously, my adoption agency had contacted me before about my mother being ill in general. We were iAbroad at the time visiting his family. I begged him to let me go see her and while I was trying to call the hospital where she was at he kept angrily telling me to be quiet and hurry up while I had the volume as low as possible and was quietly crying. He kept making annoyed noises and growling for me to be quiet and stop talking. It hurt me so deeply. In the end because of the language barrier and his cruelty I just became silent. I tried to find the hospital where she was at later but never got a response. Since that time I’ve had such a huge burden that I wasn’t there when she died and she must have died alone. It’s been my biggest regret in my life and something I’ve thought about every day.

I was so emotional knowing that she was alive tonight. It just hurt me so much he asked me to go outside instantly and walk around the neighborhood. I tried to quietly sob because of the embarrassment of walking in front of neighbors houses.

Life has been absolute shit since I can remember and I just don’t see the point in living. How I see it if there is a God he has favorites and the rest don’t have a chance. I want to kill myself but I don’t want to live eternally or because I kill myself end up in an even more worse hall than this. I just want to not exist at all. I’ve done as much I can to help others, especially have tried a lot recently and am wondering if there’s perhaps a threshold where you’ve done enough good I can kill myself and God won’t punish me. I just want to inexist peacefully, that’s all. Please. It doesn’t get better, it gets worse.",1
"I'm a 28 year old heterosexual male and pretty much as the title says. I grew up with a bangladeshi father and a half bangladeshi half afghan mother. I'm American from San Jose, California. I love both my parents, but my dad has always been a raging asshole and my childhood was filled with lots of screaming and rage and blaming and narcissism. I'm the oldest of 3. My brother is a serial monogamist and has been in 3 serious relationships and hasn't been single since he was 12. he's 26. my 24 year old sister is always dating somebody. I'm naturally a social guy, but life events have made me be more confined to my closest friends. I hang out with two friends I've known since 1st grade. I don't really make an effort to meet new people. I'm not unattractive, I train muay thai and bjj six days a week (it's a coping mechanism and an escape and a source of self esteem. I don't have much else) and I weight lift 5 days a week. In college I relied on my physique to make girls look at me or flirt with me. I used to groom myself and try to dress well. and over time through jobs, training, and whatever small amount of socializing I did in college/university, I learned how to hit on girls. I've gotten girls to like me back and I know how to flirt, but I've never sealed the deal/had sex. I'm always afraid that if I push further, it might fail and I'll remember how much of a failure I am at everything. So, I'd rather just leave the interaction on a good note. I'm worried that if they see more of me, they'll stop being attracted to me. But, since the pandemic started I've done some soul searching and am taking a break from training mma to focus on studying for the cpa exam. It's always been like this. I've always been telling myself I'm too busy for girls. I have too much worry for girls. I want to be in a good place and I feel like if I get a good job and finally move out of my parents house, I'll be in better mental shape to start dating. But, everyone else has dating experience and I never got a hoe phase. I partied with friends a good amount. but I never had a hoe phase. I'm turning 30 in 2 years. I should also mention I have had OCD and depression since I was 8. I got diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder when I was in college because I didn't do rituals. I pretty much stopped rituals between middle and high school. It's the mental part of OCD which I used to have trouble with i.e. the obsessive part. I became infatuated with some girl and I always fantasized about being with her and I wrote her a song in high school, I asked her out to prom, but I never really hung out with her or talked to her. In senior year, I had to watch her go to prom with my friend. they were dating. they had sex. ever since then, I've been really careful about approaching girls. I also feel a drop in my stomach every time I see an asian girl with a white guy (I know it's fucked up that I feel this, but I conciously have no bad feelings or judgment towards anyone in any sort of relationship and I think that's your business not mine) because it reminds me of this girl. who was asian and openly had a thing for white guys. I feel like there's no place for a brown man to an asian girl. I feel like in general many asians look down on us brown and south asian/middle eastern people and prefer white and asian men. afterwards in college, I got asian girls to like me, but I still have that feeling. I'm not sure why. I've gone to concerts and raves alone with the thought ""oh shit today might be the night"" and I mostly go into the crowd, vibe a little, maybe fuck around a bit with some people and maybe have fun, but I mostly keep to myself. and when I see girls I like, while trying to see if she's single I get all panicky in my head and start having anxiety and start getting angry in my head. I get angry that I'm inexperienced. I feel sexually inadequate. I start ruminating on my childhood and how much I hate my family and their pressure on me to get married and have kids and a lot of hate and anger towards my jackass dad who was always a raging asshole and keeps trying to control everything and everyone around him. does nothing but criticize EVERYTHING and has left me with a really strong inner critic. every single step I take is criticized and over analyzed. I hear a critical voice in my head over every thought and feeling and action. I have no fucking idea what my problem is and it's driving me crazy. I keep running over these things over and over again and try to figure out what my problem is. Why haven't I had a relationship? What is it that holds me back mentally? I wasn't sure if this was something to put in this subreddit, but it does contribute a lot to my depression and I do feel like my depression contributes to me never having been in a relationship while simultaneously causing me to be depressed about having never been in a relationship. I'm depressed about a lot of things, but this I would say is one of the main things.",1
"Hi all, I am a 20 year old uni student here in the US, and this is my first ever reddit post. I was stuggling earlier tonight, feeling like I am outside of myself, feeling like I would like to take a break from living in my own mind, feeling like there is no room left for me in this world. These are just some of the things I was feeling shortly before starting this thread, which my brother suggested I do. So, I am taking this as an opportunity to vent, as well as ask for help. 

I'd like to give some info about myself. I grew up in a ""normal"" nuclear American family. Mom, dad, older brother, and me. Although within the last couple years of uni I am learning my upbringing was anything but normal. My father was.... well, how to put it... emotionally abusive? I don't think that fully explains the extent to which my father snuffed out any emotion I/we displayed. My father during my middle school years, combined with relentless bullying caused by my weight, and inability to stand up for myself, caused what I believe to be the roots of my depression to form. He screamed, belittled, invalidated, and made me feel small. (If you're asking why my mother allowed this, she didn't participate. My mother is just as much of a victim as me, although I would be lying if I said I didn't resent her a little for just standing by and watching). For me, it was psychological torture. I will never understand how a man could scream at me and make me feel worthless, yet say he loved me more than anything in the world. He often screamed at me for things I didn't do. For HOURS (Usually ranging from 2-4 hours, not an exaggeration, baffles me to this day how he didn't tire himself out.) So, I dissociated and got extremely good at it. It was the only way I could keep myself sane from the infinite stream of bullsh\*\* put into my head. I recall in middle school there was a period I got screamed at on a daily basis, for multiple hours on end. With all this, you could assume I formed some anti-social behaviors, and got quite good and making myself as small as possible to avoid being a target in my own home and at school. (like, my presence) But now, I guess I should be thankful that I was given such a good example of who I DON'T want to be. 

The problem I am having now, with all of this, my depression. (Oddly, didn't find a lot of people discussing how their depression works) Mine, is like my father's voice. Hyper-critical of everything I do, critical towards myself to the point that it affects my self-worth. I placed myself below others for such a long time, and now in the real world, am having a rough time giving myself the time of day. I write myself off extremely early in every aspect of life without giving myself a chance. I snuff out my ambition before it can even take flame. Whenever I tell my brother about my struggles, he says, ""You need to be nicer to my brother. Love yourself like I love you, start taking care of yourself."" But I don't understand. I try to be nice to myself, but I can't. Positive self talk is something I talk w/ my therapist about, but is extremely hard to put into practice when self-critique is one of my strongest abilities. 

So, my question is, how do you all ""take care"" of yourself? It's such a foreign idea to me to give myself attention. I read, ""try to be your own biggest fan"" somewhere on this subbreddit. How do I even begin being a fan of myself? I don't like myself how I am. I don't have any motivation to take care of myself because I DON'T care about myself. But I have a feeling that I'll never be happy with myself unless I can begin appreciating myself for starts.",1
I don't understand why and I'm scared that I've fought for so long and one day it'll be for nothing. I don't know how to control this without medication that doesn't make me feel human,1
Honestly I feel done. Everything I do is taken the wrong way. Thinking of just disappearing and maybe ending it. Seems all I do is make shit worse.,1
"I feel like an old racing dog who ran the track enough times to call it retirement time and iam only 26 ! Sigh where to begin ?

I have my niece and I love her to pieces she means the whole world to me I can't do anything because I can't even picture her cute face filled with tears crying at my f*ckn funeral and having my brother and my SIL explain to her what suicide and death is !.....I feel defeated I feel like a complete and total loser in each and every way I don't want to live but I choose to because of that little girl but iam afraid that one day that even that might not be enough.....sigh WHY ! I HATE DEPRESSION ! All I want is love....acceptance......somebody to call my girlfriend.....then my wife but I honestly feel like I never will have that....",1
"I’m not too sure if I’m “depressed” but what I do know is all the posts in this thread strikes a chord with me and i feel a similar pain. I simply hate the way I look and feel daily, 24/7 I have thoughts about being ugly and how I have zero worth because of that fact. As expected I’ve never had a relationship, talked to a girl or anything, but I don’t even know how I can properly love someone when I don’t love myself. I literally matched with this chick on tinder and in my head I just kept constantly thinking she swiped right on accident because i felt like I’m just that undesirable that no relatively attractive person would even look my way. And my initial depressive thoughts weren’t always here, I use to be so happy and have so much confidence but now I feel like a fool if I open my mouth and talk to a girl. This self hate has even had me questioning my character as a whole, whether it pertains to friendships or me liking a girl. I just feel like I’am annoying and a bother and that nobody likes me as a person. This leads me to delete my social media accounts frequently bc I feel as if I’ll just b better off if i was off the grid. It’s just scary to me how all this negative feelings have materialized into what it is now. It’s started off with me thinking i was unattractive, to me thinking the world would be essentially better without me. I don’t feel suicidal but,I feel like I wish I was alone of in the middle of nowhere in small town with no wife and no kids, and since I wouldn’t see other people’s families i wouldn’t feel like i need a family of my own. I feel like I’m in the early stages of a serious illness of self hate that has gotten worse progressively. I literally one day was driving, may I add IVE NEVER cried about anything in specific when it comes to feeling sad in general but one day i thought to myself I don’t want ANYTHING on this earth besides happiness, and I’m willing to give up what I need to for that. I don’t care about how much money I make, how many friends I have or how many girls like me all i want is to wake up and not hate myself.",1
As my life goes on I’m going to spiral into killing myself,1
"Have always struggled with depression. Lost my home in 2018 when my landlord got arrested and I had to vacate. Drove cross country to stay with family and got in a six car pileup caused by icy roads. I managed to get a good paying job in 2019, bought a car, and after a year I had $30,000 in savings and was on my way to a more stable life. Covid-19 happened and I lost my job. Had a few friends die in 2020 and didn’t take it well. Got a prescription for Zoloft and lost my mind. Gave away my car to a stranger and burned through all my money. Now I have no support system, have been cut off by my community, and have almost nothing left in savings. I finally got off the antidepressants and feel like I’m back in reality. I got hired for a new job and start in a couple weeks, but after a year and a half of living on savings, I’m scared it won’t work out. The last few years have been such a whiplash of highs and lows. My current outlook is to work a 9-5 until I die. It feels so empty. I’m so tired. I am 28 years old and I feel like I have ruined my future.",1
"I’m 27 and from the US. I can’t function on my own. I don’t need people to do things FOR me, I need people to do things WITH me though. Only problem with that is that I’m always alone. I told this to my family and all they had to say was words of encouragement, “you can if you put your mind to it” etc. but it feels like nobody understands me.",1
"This is not a suicidal post, don't take it that way, there are plenty of people that have it way worse than me by fair. But FUCK. Why does this always happen? Every fucking night and every fucking week like clockwork this happens, I sit here in my room, desperate to go to sleep or to feel relax and I just stare at the fucking wall. I sit here and time goes by so fucking slow. I want to cut again, I want to text this person and tell them what's going on, I want to go wake someone up and let them know what's happening to me but I just stare at the fucking wall. 

Did you know that I had an anniversary of 2 years today? Big fucking deal for me and I'm only 17 (also M, sorry, forgot about that). We had a fun time tonight. Went to dinner, cuddled, all that shit and yet I'm still sitting here in my room alone staring at the fucking wall feeling bad for myself. There are people in this subreddit who are actually fucking suffering and I just sit here and complain. So FUCK THIS. Why does this always fucking happen? Why can't I just be fucking happy for god sake, is it really that hard? I see people everyday walking around like they don't have a care in the world but not me, no, I get to sit here and fucking hate myself. 

Maybe I should cry it out huh? That's what I thought but no, doesn't matter what I think about or how hard I try I can't get a fucking tear. I can't even just release the healthy way! And I refuse to go back to cutting, I can't do it and I won't. Why can't life just be fucking happy? Why does everything have to be so god damn hard.",1
"For context, I’m a likable guy, i am broken but i use comedy and care to combat that, thats why people care. I make my coworkers laugh, and i care about them, i listen to them when they’re sad, or when they have issues. But the other day i told one of them. I said how sad i was, and she helped me, and i could tell she cares, but now i feel like she’s worried about me, and she is. But she says that isnt a bad thing. See the reason is because she knows how i feel as she very similar issues to me. I just feel selfish how i made my coworkers and friends worried about me",1
"I'm getting really lonely and I'm getting desperate for attention. I'm 16 and still in highschool and I'm not sure why nobody wants to hang out with me. sometimes I'm socially awkward but I'm sure a lot of other people are too sometimes. my old friends said i was really easy to talk to and be around and they felt comfortable with me. i tried getting a girlfriend so i could feel companionship but they aren't really interested. I don't look horrible, i know that. i work out sometimes but i always end up losing motivation and i give up, but I'm not overweight, I'm a little underweight for my height which I'm fine with. most of the girls i know are interested in partying, getting drunk and getting railed by different guys. I'm okay with partying sometimes, I'm not that boring, but i just don't want to fuck random girls. i want my first time to be intimate. i feel normal but i don't understand why nobody wants to talk. I'm not attention seeker i just like feeling wanted and thought about sometimes. and I'm good with meeting people, but they never really want to be friends. if you have any advice, please tell me. it'd mean a lot to me.",1
"25/F. 

los angeles ca 

Its the holidays that time of the year where I feel my depression is kicking my ass even more everyday to the point I feel extremely alone. Recently I'm going thru a break that my partner decided to do . I been working on my self and in the beginning it seemed to work . But now since its November and im starting to see the holiday crap its just throwing me off. I have friends and family that care but I just feel very alone. None of my friends invite me anywhere which makes me seem they dont wanna deal with my depressed ass . I talk to my partner everyday which kinda gives me the hope to keep on going and not just give up .

Since time changed lately I been staying up late at night over thinking and thinking which is slowly killing me. Right now im having suicide thoughts which is 2nd time I had since 2 years ago . As I think I dont want it to over take me and affect my loved ones. Ugh im just so lost . I needed to vent. I hope im not the only feeling like this? I know it sucks. Im trying . Anyways .

I try not to do this, but it slips out sometimes, my brother is doing the same thing he is 1 year younger than me but he hits his desk a lot and throws stuff. My mom blames me for my brothers actions and is constantly insulting me about what I do while my brother gets away with doing all that, my mom just lets it happen he makes random noises say things that don't make sense and randomly screeches (he isn't mentally ill) My mom always comes to me about what's wrong in her life and while she is saying what's wrong, when insults me everytime I try to console her about something.Today she said how I think it's ok for people to steal stuff (she said that to my face and said I supported it) and when I tried to defend myself she told me to be quiet and admit that I supported it because I changed the way I was sitting, every time I try to defend myself she gets mad so I don't anymore and when she wonders why I don't say anything to her. I know I'm a piece of shit and I'm trying to improve but she keeps reminding me about how I'm a piece of shit and now I'm thinking how everyone hates me my friends, my family, and even pets.

"School these days are really overwhelming for me, it's getting so overwhelming that I can't live in serene anymore. I keep on worrying about my grades because they are really so terrible, I got many 80 something and can't keep all my grades on 97 or 95. It just feels like a burden! And I'm just in grade 8! Every time there is a test I study very hard, then after it, I keep on worrying about the results. And when the results come, it doesn't even live up to my expectations. One time I even failed a math test because I was too nervous. Except for tests, I still need to worry about competitions and honor classes. But it's getting so overwhelming that I start to procrastinate. There is so much work that I don't even have any time to practice the piano and read books. There is so much homework that I have to sleep at 12:00 am all the time. Every time I feel like a burden I just escape into my daydreams, but when I come back to reality, I have to face the stress again! I just feel like I'm so stupid. My close friends all got full marks or good grades on projects and tests easily, so I feel like the dumbest when you compare me to them. They are even good at every single subject at school. Every time I see their grade and compare it to me it has like a 10000000000% percentage difference. Could you please give some advice on how to cope with being stupid and school? Thanks.",1
"I don't think I can hold it any longer, panic attacks are now persistent. I can no longer hold a straight face and go on with my job. I am on the verge of a breakdown. I try to occupy myself in work but fill all my free time with sleep so I don't have to think about tomorrow. I have failed in many aspects of my life, i no longer fear failure but have accepted it as the only outcome of anything I try or do. I am defined as being a dropout, and that is what people see and want to talk about. I have also stopped conversation other than work because everything leads back to talking about me dropping out. I simply couldn't handle the stress of my final year thesis and then my self esteem buckled and I am not the same anymore. I have lost several friends during this time. My cognition, stamina, everything seems to be affected. I just don't have the strength anymore. I have consulted several doctors, taken pills, gone to therapy, nothing worked and now I don't think I can afford treatment anymore. I just wish there was a surefire cure and my best days weren't behind me. Physical illness is either curable or terminal. This, is designed for lifelong suffering. Unless I am willing to be a burden on someone, I don't think anxiety and depression ever go away.

"I was never your normal child i was more mature but there were more reason to why my mother was a drug user who would be arrested and put jail for a while and so I lived with my dad. He was nice and never really hated him and I had a sister who lived with us because her father was also a drug addict. My father would take care of us both I realized my dad treated her better because of the father and mother thing. I became quite jealous of her because my father was the only one that I knew loved me and it felt like it was taken away from me my father really had his attention on her. I never knew i was depressed and for 3rd-5th i never talked to anyone i just was there. I wanted a purpose so i would find a friend group and be friends with them and well act like them to give me some purpose to my life. I started to hate myself and never knew why. I always weared this mask that only i could see and this mask hide my true self. I started to copy my friends and also do things that i thought was cool to fill the emptiness yet i still feel empty. I need some help.

Im also having trouble sleeping and have dreams of people turning there back on me and waking up crying. I don't like being like this but i cant physically tell someone that i need help. For some reason I just cant say i need help I usually just say im fine or im very happy but im not. I also sometimes just lie that im sick to my father just so i can lay down and sleep and never wake up. I just want to have some purpose to keep me going or stop hating myself for useless...

"Okay, so I have struggled with major depression for a few years now. I have been taking anti-depressants which help with anxiety, but right now, I am feeling trapped because life at work and home has been hectic. I feel as if my only resort to peace and happiness is sleep. I went on a cruise the first week of this month, and it was an amazing experience; it really helped me unwind and find myself while exploring and trying something new. However, even before my trip, I was feeling extremely stressed and depressed due to my work life; it’s a super disorganized workplace, and I feel as if my work goes unappreciated and that I’m being taken advantage of. I have been applying for new jobs, so hopefully I will find something better. However, whenever I come home from work, I’m just so mentally exhausted and get hit with bouts of depression that I can’t even think of doing anything else. Life at home is also stressful because my dad and my brother yell and argue all day long every day. My brother has ADHD and started taking meds, but my dad gets *furious* and yells and threatens to “ruin his life” for not listening or focusing. I’m frankly over the constant fighting; I want to call somebody to help out (kinda like Supernanny only without the television aspect) but don’t want to risk being put out while I’m trying to get my life figured out. It’s frankly demoralizing and I don’t want to live with it. I know that I can’t change the behavior between my dad and brother, but I think some kind of help is necessary. What do I do in that instance? I think my brother needs extensive help with his disorder and my dad needs help managing his temper, but how do I get them that help? And how do I stop feeling trapped like I am now?",1
"I've always been the person to help others and push my needs to the side. Helping is what made me happy, and I truly didn't mind. I made a friend about 2.5 years ago, and he was struggling, but also was able to live his life beyond that. One night something happened, and all his part trauma that he repressed came flooding back. I spent a half a year doing anything and everything I could to make him feel comfortable, and to help him work through his issues towards recovery. I even prevented him from killing himself on New Years. We got a place together, and shortly after, he got drunk one night and did something that affected me very heavily. I had previously been diagnosed with a massive depressive disorder, but this event played in my head over and over. I couldn't sleep, eat, I had to leave and going home was a struggle. He truly hurt me. But we cared for each other, and (platonically) loved one another very much. We knew we could work it out, and I could get past it. It's worth noting that we both have abandonment issues, but he's the first person I trusted with my whole. I knew he wouldn't abandon me. And then he did. It was taking me too long to recover. He told me that by me having flashbacks, panic attacks, and needing to spend time away, that it felt like he couldn't live his life. He's progressed amazingly and is finally excited to live and see the future. But he couldn't do that with me around. So I had to move out. It feels selfish, but I struggled so much when I was helping him recover, and it feels like I was just kicked aside. By the person I loved and trusted the most. The only person I truly believe wouldn't do that to me. Any hope I had of wanting to see brighter days is gone. I don't think I'll ever get to experience happiness, and I don't know what to do. The only thing keeping me alive is the thought of my sister and nephew crying, but I don't know how long that can last.",1

Because of this it thinks that the best choice by far is suicide because its like sleep but better and forever and it negates all positives and negatives and sacrificing the positives is a great trade when I cant even miss out on anything when I'm dead because I'm dead. Consequently I'm having all of these feelings at once to my collective consciousness if that makes sense. I don't enjoy anything anymore and dont have the strength to keep going on and suffering through stuff just to finally get away and start a life that's gonna be a 4/10 at most.

"Hello there,
Thanks for coming to my rant. I’m 23 and live in a remotish area of Utah. I was always fairly popular growing up. Never had problems making friends or finding joy in life through people. However recently moved to Utah after graduating college. Got an amazing job. However I have spent the last year alone besides the occasion family visit. Tried making friends etc. I’m fairly self aware and know I’m probably suffering from early parts of depression. But honestly at this point I’m filled with the is this it?mentality. Work,come home. Maybe watch tv or video games. Go to the gym couple times. And that’s it. Seems no matter what I try I’m not happy with my current situation. Doesn’t help I work almost always alone. So limited human interaction drives me mad. Also not being apart of the Mormon community I feel like a complete outcast. Any tips or tricks would be great.

everything i do makes them mad and when i cry it makes them madder. they get extremely mad when i cry. i dont know what to do.

"Lately I’ve had large amounts of overbearing thoughts regarding death. Not suicide, just death in general. It will hit me at random times and I can’t get my mind off it without an outside force. The actual thoughts are usually like “one day I will die, and that is probably it, nothing else.” When I’m alone without friends or maybe with only 1 friend if it’s bad enough, I become extremely unmotivated and feel sick, or like I’m going to cry. I’m still fairly young, and I reckon I’ll live about 6x the years I’ve lived now, but it still terrifies me to think about death, but at the same time my brain wants to. I would like tips for avoiding this without the need of outside stimulus, as my obsession for games has become less about fun and more about stopping myself from thinking too much. I don’t think I am in any danger, and I have no plan to kill myself, as it’s pretty much the other way around. I want to keep living so bad, but the mere thought of dying and never existing again is horrifying. I’m not sure where I stand religiously, I want to believe there’s a higher power, but at the same time there’s so many “if you’re not with us you’re against us” religions, and I’d rather not even try to lie to myself. I think death is the end. But I wish for a Heaven, my thoughts are contradicting and I could really use some help with solving this as I don’t know what to do.",1

"I know it’s a pretty common thing that I (and people in general) say - that it’s okay to not be okay. But I’m don’t think I ever really believed it til recently. I’ve been through 3 episodes of major depression so far and I am only 25. Every time the cycle begins anew to this point I’ve always been riddled with guilty, which never did me any good obviously. 

I don’t really know for sure what changed. But I’ve more or less come to terms with the fact that depression is likely to be a lifelong companion of mine in some capacity or another. And that’s okay, because I’ve learned how to cope in relatively healthy ways. I’ve beaten it multiple times and I know I can do it again.

Don’t know why I felt like sharing, but I hope y’all can be okay with it too.",1
"I bought a knife a year and a half back for a pretty good price . Good quality , length, has multiple uses . I have used it multiple times in myself and it works well . I haven't in a long time . In a way I'm afraid but at the same time I had known it was coming",1
"Every day it gets harder for me to keep any motivation to keep going. I feel myself getting heavier and heavier to the point that I don’t even want to move no more. I just want to keep crying and crying cause i don’t know what to fucking do anymore. I’m losing so much hope in everything and everyone I just can’t take it, I don’t feel love at all anymore and it hurts. I just want to sleep and just dream forever.",1
"For the past 4 days, I haven't gone to school at all. I just stayed home. Now, I'm having some decent time at home, but just the thought of going to school is exhausting.

My mom is a bit of a judgy person, and I don't know if I should tell her. She might just tell me ""too bad, you gotta go to school"". I also feel terrible for not going. I'm ruining my grades and I feel like a lazy piece of shit. 

I really don't know what to do. I'm doing everything I'm supposed to be doing, I'm taking my pills, sleeping alright, exercising, eating. So I'm not sure if actually my depression. And it sucks because I blame myself for being like this. 

I don't know if I'm going to school today. I might talk on the phone with the school therapist. We'll see. I need to take courage to tell my mom I'm not going. Is this cowardly? Am I just hiding and running away from my problems? Maybe I'm just lazy.",1
"I've just recently finished reading Shadowhunters and i had a completely mental breakdown. I cried until there was no more water left in my body. My heart aches at the thought that that world i want to so badly live in isn't real. It physically hurts me. Ir feels like someone is craving a knife into my heart and soul and making a deep hollow whole. 

This happens with an unfortunate frequency and it tends to have its highest when i finish a show or a book that i have gotten myself so emotionally attached.

My knees feel weak, they can no longer sustain my body. I fall with my hands covering my heart, it is painful and only those who have been in love with fictional characters, and yes i do mean in love, know how painful it is to bear such thing.

My face wet with salty tears. I'm a mess. I can feel him beside me but not really. His face is tender and his expression filled with compassion, i crave his touch more than anything in the world. But i can't have it. We are from different realities. 

He places a hand on my back and i can feel it. I want to reach for it but if i do then i know it'll be gone. So i leave it there. My mind is playing tricks on me, but the sorrow i have is enough to cover up for that fact.

I might sound crazy to world outside these four walls, but i assure you, everyone is a little crazy. And look around you this reality, this timeline, the destruction, the chaos, the evil that this world carries. How and why would you possibly want to live here? I usually love chaos but not this one.

Humans have slaughtered almost every species on the planet, including their own. The planet is dying by the second and no one seems to care. Everyone is just so damn selfish. 

No wonder kids these days have depression and anxiety. The world is ending, i am trying my best everyday to make this planet a better place but there's still so many things to be done and so little time.

I wonder sometimes. No. I wonder everyday, every second of my meaningless and dull life: what would if be like to like in a world where i could fight demons, kill vampires or become one of them, become a superhero, be part of a group of prisoners of a space ark. What would it be like to touch him and her and know they are real? To have them, to feel his arms around me as i fall asleep, to wake up and see his face staring back at mine.",1
"I know probably no one cares, but I need help, I'm getting to a point where I can't take it anymore, it's the combination of no one caring and ""you'll be fine"" but I'm getting worse, I don't wanna admit it but I need help and idk what to do anymore, I feel like I'm slowly just losing it and no one cares, I've talked to multiple people and it's always the same answer. Idk anymore I'm worried and scared for myself that its gonna get to a point where I can't do anything about it and it seems like I can't do anything, I don't wanna take pills, and I know for a fact that therapy won't help, I just feel like I need a hug but there's no one, I've always been the one there for others and now that I am in desperate help, that's when no ones there.",1
"I’ve just been fighting off the urge of wanted to post something here. I can’t anymore. I don’t have anyone anymore. I have never fucking felt like this. It freaks me out and makes everything worse. Everyone just underestimates the pain and misery I’m going through. I’m so sick and tired of hearing. it’s just a phase, It’s not a phase if it’s my life. It hasn’t changed and at night I can’t fucking help wanting to choke myself. Or hang I just can’t anymore. I’m so uninterested in people and everyone around me. It just feels like I’m just going to the motions. That I’m a ghost I’m phasing in and out my life and I just can’t. i can’t even do anything about it I’m just stuck. even music which used to help me just, makes me feel worse all the different type of songs don’t help anymore. No sounds no feelings. I feel dead and I’m desperately trying to find any reason to just find a reason why I’m just so unreasonable. i used to be ok. just fine. Still depressed but ok. i hate it. I don’t even want to get up anymore. i don’t even want to type anymore. I just want to sleep or cry. i can’t do shit. i just want to leave. I want to go home. i hate moving places, I’m just juggling so many disorders I don’t understand anymore about what to do about it anymore. i lost everyone near me for me and I am driven crazy by family so much. I just can’t not feel like having murderous thoughts. i am 16 people telll me that “oh you should be enjoying your life you can only be a kid once” how the FCUK am I supposed to feel anything, if the only thing I’m surrounded by is people who don’t fucking care about me, people who don’t bother to answer to my constant screams for help. i don’t want to be alive, I don’t care about academics. I just want to go back to my old home. Atleast then i could have someone to tell me it’s okay. I can barely breathe rn…I wish I could just leave my personal hell. Everything is pointless and I’m being told I’m nothing all the time. Thanks I needed that. I just want to runaway or blast my brains out. I don’t want to keep going. There’s no reason to anymore. No reason to live…should I even…care…it’s not like it’s gonna change for me…it’s whatever…",1

"Soooo, I'm turning 25 on Thanksgiving, and feeling it coming is throwing me into a pit. 
I feel miserable anymore, and I was a teenager that thought some really dark stuff.
Social media escalates the inescapable politics x10. I see all the friends (?) that I used to be so close to years ago that I don't even talk to anymore, and it makes me wonder if I'm a piece of crap, or it just makes me angry because every time I've tried to reach out, it doesn't go beyond ""I'm good, you?"". I feel so different from everyone around me. I live in the middle of nowhere so I can't ""get a hobby and meet new people"". My SO and I have been together for a few years and I'm starting to question our future every so often, but we're working through it. His friends are also changing into completely new people, and it just makes me feel even more crazy. 
My family wants to hold thanksgiving/my birthday for me, and I have a rocky relationship with them since forever that I'm trying to get past as an adult, and try to put things in the past. My SO usually picks his family over mine, which is fine, but I'm starting to hate being around them because they're super political and I just can't stand it anymore. Originally he was going to spend Thanksgiving with his family and I was going to go to mine, and he wasn't willing to compromise because all of my family besides my parents live a little further which kinda agitated me because he sees his family every weekend while I never see mine. (Before my parents asked if I wanted to come to the house and my boyfriend changed his mind to hitting both houses, which I'm not doing anyway). I'm really hoping that seeing my family goes smoothly, but I really just want to cry. I feel completely isolated. I just want to uproot myself and move, but I'm not sure that would even make me feel better. I've felt like this a majority of my life, but now it's worse than ever.",1
"Every time I feel a small breakthrough, I’m reminded of how I’m a “bad person.” I kept trying to be true to myself, and the people around me. I set boundaries for myself (and more importantly for others), stopped using substances, and cleared my head of all the anger and hate I had. 

I thought I was doing well, I found a career I loved, the love of my life came back into my life (and this time I thought this meant she was my soul mate), she let me see our puppy again, my health was doing better - I was exercising daily, I was going on trips, seeing live music which was healing my soul.

But now I can’t see her, I can’t see our puppy. My health is getting much worse, I’m too scared to make a doctors appointment. My work has me put on a notice because I have been so distracted. I can’t concentrate. I can’t seem to find a reason to smile.

I’m still in control of my anger. I have no hate. I’ve been genuine and honest with the people around me. I don’t know what else to do. I hugged my uncle last week who survived a stroke and I started crying. I don’t know why, but it was the most real hug I had felt in a long time. 

Is any of this normal?? I hate feeling so distant from myself.",1
"Depression and suicide never made any sense to me. I thought depression was just feeling unhappy and you could will yourself out of it and suicide was a weak person's way of giving in to life. I now realize I was an asshole for holding that mindset as ironically life has continued to beat me down for 5 straight years. In 5 years I have acomplished absolute nothing despite my best efforts. I keep going because I don't think I have the courage to make it stop.

Life is difficult. And. I've come to realize you can't go at it alone. But people will only superificially offer you help. They'll ask you how you feel not because they care or because they wish to help you but because we are taught to ask each other how things are. It becomes a habit and when someone speaks out and says things are going bad and they need help the people who so casaully ask you how you are find themselves dumbfounded and just awkwardly changing the subject or avoiding you. 

I hate telling anyone how I feel as I have grown to hate people for their superficial support. They ask how you are but don't truly want to know. I hate the grind that is life. Despite people repeatedly saying money doesn't give life value that's untrue. Without money you can't do anything. So you find yourself grinding away your adult life trying to make something of yourself. I work day in and day out achieving absolute nothing. I try and give my life meaning by helping those around me. But I also realize I'm just an easy out for them. It's easier to have me be the shield from the storm then for them to face it themselves. 

Nobody cares. Nothing is worth the grind. I am in a slump I can't escape no matter how I try. I feel empty. I have no purpose. My life has no meaning or value. It sucks when you realize these things. I thought I would make something of myself. But I now realize I've wasted my life. Each day on earth is just more wasted time. But I can't bring myself to end it either. I'm a coward. I'd much rather strugle on then just end it. I don't know what to do. I so want help. I need help. But. No one is able to provide it. I just need a chance. I just need something to happen. A spark to light my fire.",1

Small chance I might be prescribed lexapro tomorrow. Im just wondering
1) How common is it to have sexual dysfunction AFTER discontinuation if lexapro?
2) Is there anyone he is taking (or who took) lexapro and did not have sexual dysfunction? Whats your gender?
3) If Lexapro worked for a sibling, will it work for me?

At this point, happiness is such a foreign concept and sounds like it’s a lot of work. Everything sounds like it’s a lot of work. What I truly desire is peace. Having to do nothing, feeling nothing, and in an eternal state of rest.",1

All the things people thought about me were true: that I was an idiot; that I was a loser; that I was a piece of crap. So much has gone wrong in my life that at this point I honestly think it's my fault. It's my fault I got beatings. It's my fault my parents weren't happy with their marriage because if I wasn't in the middle they would've gotten along.,1
"I don't know why I'm bothered by this question. With antidepressants I'm much less impulsive, my emotions are more stable, and my relationships with people and myself are better. Without medication, I feel like I (and others) suffer more from my symptoms of depression and borderline. Which is the REAL me? Does it matter?

Does any one else feel like they feel like different people when you're on medication vs. when you're not?",1

"A couple months ago I was prescribed antidepressants for the first, the ones that we’re prescribed to me we’re Effexor. Now I heard some pretty horrible shit about it so I decided to never even go get the prescription.

"I’ve had depression to various degrees throughout my life, though I’ve never been seriously suicidal. I guess I’m lucky in that way. I think I can at least partially attribute that to my family support system. I know that if I ever hit rock bottom and just give up on life my parents will be there for me. I know that the worst think that could happen to me is institutionalization (which I know can be hellish for some people, but I’m confident my parents would be careful to pick a place that would actually help and not make me miserable, whatever the financial cost). I’m wondering if there’s anyone in a similar situation, with severe depression without suicidal ideation, and what you attribute that to. Or, for people who are suicidal, do you lack a similar support system? What do you think would help you no longer want to die? Also, I should mention, I feel like I’m doing a lot better these days, I don’t even know if I still have MDD.",1

"It’s been almost 3 years since I got stuck inside my head. My life has completely changed since then. I remember I was so happy and full of life. Now, I’m just a guy who is just staying alive and letting time pass by. Sometimes its very hard to pass the time. It feels like I’m stuck somewhere and I cannot get outside. The things that made me happy before doesn’t work anymore. I make so many to do list and next day I don’t even look at the list. I check on my social media and see my friends posts and their stories, and I know not all of them is true but I feel they at least have something to fake and then I feel crap. There is not a single thing that excites me right now. The day just passes by without doing anything. I feel frustrated that I cannot even keep myself happy and busy. Life feels meaningless.",1
I want to cry . I want to allow myself to feel emotions. I also want people to stop coming to me saying they only want to be fucked . LIKE WHAT . I've lost people I have truly loved . I have been used for so long as well . Please make it stop . I WANT SOMEONE TO CARE . ALL I AM IS A OBJECT,1
"I'm not saying that I don't feel emotions. But unlike before, the intensity of my emotions has dropped so much that I'm not sure if I can keep calling that way. I'm not sure if it is a problem of recognition of my own sensations, but i can't tell anymore if im feeling angry or sad for example. I can only say that im feeling ""comfortable"" / ""uncomfortable"" and nothing more.
Somehow I think this helped me. You know? At least I'm no longer complaining about myself all day like i used to, nor do my memories affect me as before. Everything would be fine if it weren't for the fact that now i feel literally dead. I mean, not feeling bad is great, but being unable to feel good isn't. Just frustrating...",1
"Two years ago my friend group ghosted me. We grew up together, were always like sisters, I thought we’d be friends for life. Suddenly they stopped including me and I never heard from them again. The three of them are still friends. So they just mutually agreed that I wasn’t wanted anymore. Reason unknown. I confided in my boyfriend about what a painful experience it was. How I wished I could have one last conversation with them to understand what went wrong. Fast forward 2 years and my boyfriend does the same thing to me. He ghosted me knowing how hard it was for me to cope with being ghosted by them. Im disposable to everyone. I am now completely alone in the world. Not a single friend or anything close to one.

"Today I came back to university after a weekend at home helping my mom move houses. It's almost the end of the term so off campus housing has been something on everyone's minds these days. I had planned to rent a house off campus with my current roommate and 4 other girls, and we had casually discussed this multiple times. When I was at home on Saturday I got a call from one of these girls saying that ""We have decided as a group that no one wants to live with you next year and that we will be moving on with getting a house without you."" I was extremely upset and in disbelief that EVERY ONE of my friends suddenly didn't want to live with me anymore and were excluding me. I felt horrible to be the one person being isolated like this. I cried for 3 straight hours almost because having friends turn on me like this is just so painful. I already lost my dad this year and was hoping to make friends during university, but clearly no one cares. Once I came back to campus, I met with all of my friends and then confirmed that nobody wants to live with me next year. When I asked them why, everyone was bullshitting and saying things like ""you're a nice person but the dynamics would be off if we lived with you"" without giving me a valid reason. I understand that no one is obligated to be my roommate but this just really hurt like a ton of bricks. It was hard not to get upset in front of my so called friends, but the pain of being excluded like this was just too much to handle.

Now I just feel hurt, betrayed, and lost. I don't know who I'm going to live with next year. I need to find new friends but I don't know how. 
Everything just really hurts right now.",1
"I feel like life just loves to hurt me for some reason. I’m unable to even enjoy anything that I used to enjoy doing anymore, things that used to kind of take my mind off of things just don’t work anymore. Yet I keep trying them because they’re all I’ve got to do to keep my mind occupied. 

For some time I had someone who I loved so dearly with my heart like true, genuine and pure love that I would have literally given the whole world just to see them smile. They truly were my whole world. And they made me so happy but now they’re not with me and it feels like there’s a void in my life because I just love them so much and I really wanted to spend my life with that person. She was the best thing that ever happened to me. It just hurts. 


There’s so much in this world that hurt me throughout my life since I was a kid, a lot more than I could list here and I often remember those things and it feels like life has been really unfair in many ways. yet for some reason im still holding on to life hoping things would get better, hoping I’d be happy one day and I won’t feel so lost, alone and empty anymore. One day I want to find my happiness, to be able to say that I went through it all and I didn’t give up… but it’s just hard. 


Im trying my best in life but im genuinely scared that maybe im the problem or maybe im not a good person? God I wish I could be better. I wish I could improve… im really doing my best to be better every day but im exhausted and scared… 


I can’t really talk to anyone about this so I’m grateful for this community where I could at least vent, maybe someone relates or maybe im just screaming into the void by writing down my thoughts and feelings… but I guess it’s better than not saying anything at all. The hurt never goes away though…",1

For example if I am stressed or anything like that a go and masterbate to make it go away like the pathetic fucking loser I am.

"I’m in high school. My parents had a rough divorce, my mom is super guilting and my best friend moved away to Florida. Ever since I haven’t felt happy. I don’t know what it feels like anymore. I have other friends, but I feel like an extra to them. They all are in relationships, and I overhear how amazing it is. I’m short and introverted. Nobody is interested in me. I’ve been cuting myself as a way to feel something but it’s not doing enough for me. I’ve been seriously thinking about ending it all but I’ve had a want to experience life’s joys, but that crutch is fading. After all this I’ve always felt as my problems aren’t as grand as others. I’m always bored and tired. I waste most of my days sleeping and alone. I’m a half a year away from getting my license so I’m stuck in the house and can’t get away. Even if I get there I probably won’t have a car anyway. My uncle has always been there for me but my mom has not been letting me see him. What do I do with my life. Not does anything for me anymore.

"I don’t know how to describe how I feel. I can only write what comes to mind. Locked, restrained. Which, is very frustrating actually. But its tranquilized. Locked, again. I want to break the world. I’ve wanted to do so ever since I moved to a different continent as a child. A continent of which I did not know the language and was treated like shit. I was bullied for years, and my parents did not take it seriously. ‘He’s a child he’ll adapt’, that’s the feeling I got from them. Meanwhile I was afraid almost every night, knowing I have school tomorrow. I had to find ways to relieve myself from the constant anxiousness. I found a way to release dopamine by watching porn. I still watch it now, to find comfort in times of distress and anxiousness. I never seemed to heal from what happened those years I was abroad. Its tucked away somewhere, and honestly I don’t think I’ll ever find it again. I don’t believe people who tell me they enjoy my company, or say that I’m strong, or compliment me in whichever way. I say I do, and I convey my gratitude but, I don’t feel nothing. It’s always cold. And one person has shaken it’s foundation, but I can’t break it. It’s what allowed me to cope when my heart was open and able to receive. It’s closed now, and I don’t think it’ll ever open. I can’t connect with people, truly. I don’t want to. Sex is repulsive to me, and I find parents are ugly. That may sound odd, but I think their characters are selfish, naïve and ironically childish. I feel socially rejected, and my thoughts reflect that. I assume that anyone reading this would reject me all the same. And maybe that’s me. Or maybe it’s the identity and role I’m forced to play in order to explain how I feel about myself and the world. Even though society won’t accept me, they’ll place me in a category, and I’ll understand what is expected of me in relation to that. In the end I feel like we all just want to understand our place, and be content with that. I don’t know if I’m content with this but at least I understand, and can behave accordingly. At least I’m not as lost as I was as a child in an environment I did not know. At least I can live as such, where I cannot be taken advantage of, because I know what I am. I thought writing this out would help, but it doesn’t. jlkjkljkjdlkjlkjjlksfdjlkdjlkfklkjlfdsljkjljk;
I’ve looked up for some kind of wire with plastic around it, so it wont cut into the throat too much. I hope maybe it will be more comfortable that way. Eventually cuts the oxygen and allow me to pass out. I won’t have the courage to do it though. It would have to be really impulsive, and that’s not who I am. Maybe if I damage myself to the extent where I’d be more susceptible to impulsive behavior, I would. I think I sound sick, but I believe I cant be cured. I’ve spend years in therapy and in clinics. It works a while because you’re put in a bubble. But eventually they all burst. Sometimes I think I’m better off in jail. Where people just condition me. I’ve got too much time, too much freedom to hurt myself. Society looks after the collective, not the individual. Good luck mfkjglj",1
"i’ve struggled with anxiety and depression for a long time, but recently it has gotten bad. i think the spiral started from a dream i had about kissing my best friend. i have never had romantic feelings for her (or literally any other girl, i’ve always considered myself straight) but for some reason that dream made me think i was in love with her. then, she cancelled plans with me for halloween to go out of town to a party a few hours away. she ended up meeting this rich, handsome, great older guy who she’s super obsessed with now and has been driving hours to see him. the thing is, we don’t ever really hang out outside of our job that we work together, so it’s not like her going out of town has me seeing her less. every time she says something about him i get SO JEALOUS though, and i honestly can’t tell who i’m jealous of.
anyway, this whole situation has been a source of so many awful emotions over the last few weeks. i’ve cried myself to sleep countless times. i’ve convinced myself everyone hates me. i thought about suicide for the first time. i know this all sounds ridiculous over this tiny situation, and i agree that it IS ridiculous. i don’t know why i feel this way. i guess it sucks that one of my only friends is moving on in life, while i’m stuck here as a lame 23 year old virgin whose friends don’t even want to hang out with her. 
my birthday is this weekend. i fully expect her to ditch me for this guy anyway. i know i’m going to be heartbroken. i just hope i make it through.
i have an appointment thursday to hopefully switch antidepressants. i’m praying the switch works.",1
"Female, 18, uk, neuroscience university student. 

Currently on week 6 of sertraline, going onto week 7 (50mg). First couple of weeks I had nausea and light headaches, which resolved themselves, but the last week or so I have developed major insomnia. 

I take my sertraline at 4pm and attempt to sleep at around 1-2am, however I often cannot fall asleep until 6am-10am, and then have multiple small sleeps in the afternoon/evening. Obviously not ideal when all I want is just to be able to go to my lectures and do my uni work. 

I’ll feel tired, yawning etc but when I try to sleep I’m wide awake and just can’t get to sleep. 

Took fluoxetine for a year before this but did no affect my sleep

So incredibly frustrating",1

23 (F) 

I have no idea how to care for myself. How to be an adult. 

I have had a privileged life where my family can pay for my higher ed. I now have a degree in media arts. But am still what most would consider an idiot. I've been a chameleon my whole life. Influenced by those around me and now I realize that I have no idea who I really am. 

I never meant to hurt people but I feel like by merely existing I've caused harm by overreacting to things and being insecure. I nearly lost my current job w/ a nonprofit cause I had a breakdown and somehow thought going into outpatient care and being honest about my suicidal thoughts was a good idea (spoiler alert it's not, it gets you admitted). I feel so much shame. yet I keep falling into patterns of victimizing myself. First day back at work tomorrow and I'm nervous.

"Mom left me when I was 3, father died when I was 10. Went through a couple years with an abusive aunt but now I live with my uncle. Currently 18 and have been ruining my brain with drugs since I was late 14. Frequently experience brain fog, every relationship I have is falling apart. Used to be thought of as gifted and talented, now looked down upon as my grades started dropping due to being incredibly lazy. Can't seem to enjoy a single thing besides using drugs. Probably won't get into college even though everyone expects me to. I failed at commiting suicide yesterday, don't know if I'm going to last much longer.",1
"I'm a gay white Brazilian lower-middle class male. I for a long time thought I was ok with my parents divorce - they were always really different from each other and fought a lot, plus my father cheated on my mother twice.

But I've been doing therapy for some time and realized I still have subconscious issues because of it. For instance, I don't remember anything from the year they split. Not even from school. I also still struggle a lot with conflict.

This gets worse given that I'm on the verge of another break-up from my mom and my stepfather. I support her decision of splitting from him, but this couldn't come in worse times.

It's been only slightly more than a year since we moved to our own house. A house her and my stepfather built with both their money and mine and from my stepbrother. We're indebted, my mother has 2 dogs and - wait for it - 30 cats.

My mom is a really stressed out person, having lived with a plethora of traumas of her own and just recently started therapy and taking antidepressants. She usually gets in huge dramatic fights over things she usually has *some* reason, but quickly loses her reason with her attitudes.

Today we had one of those. I don't even know what it was about and I don't want to. But the yelling and the fighting threw me off balance and I had to quit an online meeting I was gonna have. I couldn't get my bearings since (it's been 5 hours).

I was gonna sleep early, but then I tried brushing it off and started watching DnD Beyond's campaign on YouTube. I was really into it, until I heard my mother crying downstairs. At first I didn't really wanna go - I knew she was drunk and I already expected she would try to deflect and pretend it was nothing and would get mad at me for getting worried.

But then, she's my mother and I couldn't let her cry by herself. You have to understand the last time I saw her cry was prior to my parents divorce, when (my stepmother now) the other woman was belittling her on phone and I, a kid, had to ask her to stop. My mom didn't cry even when I tried to kill myself - her reaction was to get mad at me.

I went downstairs, asked her what was happening and she stopped crying and replied she was only crying because ""she likes the dogs"" and had told me she is gonna take them with her when she gets the divorce - not the freaking 30 cats, though...

I tried to ask her more, but she deflected again and acted like I was overreacting. I'm angry until now.

The suicidal thoughts came back because
1. I'm tired of fights and struggles
2. I don't see a way out of this cycle
3. I fear becoming like her, the way she's becoming her mother (mental illness runs through my mom's family, my grandma, my aunt, her and I suffer from many, I was the first to actually look for help)
4. I'm tired of getting to a plateau of safety and comfort where I feel I'm stable enough to aim for something in my life (I didn't finish no graduation, despite starting 5) only for it to get swept from under my feet.
5. I know this separation is gonna be worse than the first because my father, despite all his flaws, is and was always a calm person - even his anger is more subtle. My stepfather, however, is not. And neither I nor my mother trust him.
6. I can't bear to think what's gonna be of the cats. My mom says the cats are my stepfather's, but she's the one who takes care of them and who rescued many of them from the streets - and who named them and didn't let others go to adoption when they were born. I told her to at least figure out a place for them - but she got angry at me and told me I shouldn't worry about it.
7. The best way out for me would be to move away and live by myself, away from all this, but my wage isn't enough, Brazil is going through a huge crisis, so I can't change jobs and I don't have a degree yet.
8. I have no energy to reach for those goals with such uncertainty up ahead.

I did send all of this to my therapist, but I'm only scheduled on Wednesday evening with her.",1

"Hi, I have experienced depression for most part of my life, since I was about 8yo, it came in waves and never bothered me too much. I had quite successful youth, normal family, enough friends, good academics, good love life, etc. A series of unfortunate events happened in the last 3 years and they seem to have triggered a major depression episode, which push me down to the point where I feel like I have lost the ability to function as a normal human being. In 2019, at the age of 32 I was diagnosed with peyronies disease, which obviously is not a deadly condition but it's highly debilitating for a youngish man like I am. In 2020 the pandemic forced me to work from home (I still am) which worked out as both a course and a blessing. Also In 2020 my father developed dementia (it was probably there for a while, but the lockdown accelerated the symptoms), and I decided to relocate to my parents house to help my father. (It's 34yo me + 81yo father + 62yo mother + 96yo grandma also with dementia) Caring for my dad it's not easy, I had to pull the handbrake on my career in a big tech, moved from being full time manager to part time developer. Also this put big strain on the relationship with my partner, we had been leaving together for 8 years, but thankfully she understood and accepted my choice. We have now found a place close to my dad and in the process of buying it. Dementia is a horrible disease and it's getting worst day after day.
I lost the ability to socialized with any of my friends, I just don't answer of if I answer I refuse to partecipate to any activity, partially because I am scared of bringing COVID or any other disease to my father.
I spend most of my free time in bed consuming social media or any other mindless enterteinment. I only go out for walks with my father, or with my partner. My productivity at work is close to zero, I just stare at the screen unable to code anything at all. I lost the ability to sleep for more then couple of hours before having nightmares and waking up. I often find myself crying listening to music or having nostalgic thought. I very low sex drive. I often am obsessed with the past and I find myself thinking that is my bad decisions and behaviours that brought the bad luck to me and in my family. I am not suicidal, but I am constantly having suicidal intrusive thoughts, (i.e. intrusive thought about how good would be to be dead and how could I achieve that). I can't even order a pizza without panicking about it. I have not been getting a haircut for the past 2 years and find it difficult to keep up with most basic hygiene such as brushing teeth (I am doing it but I honestly have to put a monumental effort into it)",1
"I’ve been suffering with my mental health since I was little. Recently I keep getting depressive episodes, usually they only happen once every month. Now, they keep happening, one after the other. I have no motivation to do anything, I can’t be bothered to do anything. I honestly don’t care what happens in the future, I just don’t want to be here anymore. I feel numb most of the time, all I do is sleep. I just want it to end",1
"I don't know how to describe it. I don't want to suicide. But life seems extremely awful. I am at the lowest point right now. I have been crying for hours and i don't even know why. The only person i have and can trust in my life is my gf. We are both codependent to each other in an unhealthy way i think. We are not doing well for a long time now. On top of that she Will even leave the country for 6 months for a job. She is leaving in 2 months. I can't help but feel desperate. We might even break up because of the distance.

I have noone else in this world. I love her and i don't want to lose her. I don't want to be alone. I have friends supposedly but i dont feel any real connection with anyone. I do not expect life to get any better in the future. Financially i am not good either.

I feel like i have been burying my emotions the last months and that today i exploded. I can't keep fooling myself. 

I can't keep studying. I can't keep lifting. I can't keep socializing. I barely eat the last days. Today i went 24 hours straight without eating. I don't have any goals and I can't see life in a positive way. I wasn't like this some time ago , I can't understand what changed.

Whatever you tell me , you can't take my feeling of doom off me",1
"i got a lot to unpack here. this is gonna be really long so i dont expect anybody to really read all this i just need to express all these thoughts.

fuck depression. fuck everything that comes with it. i cant believe my life has come to this point. everyday I wake up feeling awful and remain that way throughout the whole day. i haven't been able to feel any joy for more than a couple hours for idk how long. on top of that, all the joy feel doesn't feel right. it feels out of place. ive consistently felt so depressed for so long that its become normal. feeling good, feeling relieved or even remotely ok doesnt feel right. its almost as if i subconsciously pull myself out of good situations because i dont feel comfortable in them, as much as i dont want to feel like shit either.

im tired of people telling me the same things over and over again. i understand that theyre just trying to help but it doesnt help. its just annoying. if somebody tells me its gonna get better one more time im gonna lose my mind. it doesnt get better, evidently. it only gets worse. in general, im just tired of people telling me the same things. 

i cant sleep normally, i cant eat normally, i cant take care of myself hygienically because my stupid brain wont allow me to. i dread every day because i know its only going to be filled with suffering. everytime i have any hope that things will get better, it all comes crashing down. its this endless loop of feeling like things gets better but it just plummets back down to this depressive, suicidal state im in. it feels like nothing matters. theres no point in doing anything that i do when i could just kill myself. i just dont want to live anymore. it also feels like nobody really cares until i say that. it feels like people trying to support me is a chore for them and im just an inconvenience but when i say i want to kill myself thats when they actually care.

i cant look at myself in the mirror without feeling disgusted. i hate the way i look and i hate the person ive become. every day i just go downwards as a person both mentally and physically.

people keep asking me if im ok. clearly they dont understand what depression entails. im never ok. i never feel genuine, pure happiness. only depressive thoughts. 

everything exhausts me. living is exhausting. i just want it to end but it feels like it never will.",1
"So, in the six months I have been defamed with awful lies, rendered homeless, 20k in debt, have an eviction on my record now. Due to the defamation I’m starting over at 29 and so can’t move anywhere because the eviction which has stranded me in a town that actively hates me.

"I finally found something that helped with my depression. This weekend I've been so productive and feeling actually upbeat. This is after almost a year of fighting suicidal thoughts, but trying to hold myself together since I have kids. Today some really bad things happened that I would rather not talk about because it's out of my control anyway. I'm just finding myself in tears and lying in bed for hours again praying for mercy.

"(my boring story) In three days it would have technically been my fourth wedding anniversary. It's been 11 months since I got just a 10 minute phone call from my wife explaining she didn't love me anymore and basically ghosting me. Details aside (you'd be surprised to learn there really isn't many details, I've come to realize I'll never get closure) the only happy memories I have are time spent with her. Im very thankful I felt what it was like to *be* happy even if this horrible disease has wrecked me for decades. I may be even more of a ghost of even my depressed past, but I guess I'm working towards one day feeling a fraction of that happiness I once felt briefly. I guess that's what keeps me going? How about you? I thought it would be a little better in my early thirties. The love of my life is gone, but I guess I have to keep going? Do I though? I have our pets to take care of, other than that is there really a reason?

Hope you're doing ok though, stranger.",1
Idk a single relationship were someone hasn’t cheated or was just a complete pos. I want a family and marriage and everything but I’m way to scared to even try.

Nothing intreasts me anymore. There been good days but the bad days never stop. They keep getting worse and worse. I need help and can't get it. Should I go 100k in debt if it make me happy? I'm thinking about just going yolo and do a month or year worth of fun stuff and then killmyself so I won't have to worry about the debt. I wish unemployment was as easy as the fucking conservative say it is. If I just had 3 months to beable to fix my mental health I could do it but thats impossible in this fucking shit ass america.

"I’ve always been the person to check in on my friends. Ask them how they’re doing, ect. But nobody does the same for me. I get not sitting with me through anxiety attacks or other episodes but just asking how I am isn’t hard. Most of them barely respond to my texts. It’s not cause they don’t like me but it starts to feel like it when it’s days worth it a response. None of my friendships feel deep either. They all feel super shallow to me. And on top of that I’m an outcast with social anxiety so I can’t exactly make new friends easily. I’ve tried to hard but gotten nowhere. I kinda want to die",1
"I am completely and utterly hopeless about my life. I feel like my life has been nothing but pain and suffering.

Anyways, college has been absolute hell for me, and recently I guess I was mentally broken. I’m christian, and I was really praying for something, and it looked like I was gonna get it, and then I had it ripped away from me. It was painful and I spent a weekend it pure agony worrying about it. That event, compounded with everything else in my life, has made me believe that God hates me, and my entire life is gonna be this way. Over the last 2 weeks I have been constantly thinking about just killing myself because I feel like my life is torture. Currently I wouldn’t kill myself because I don’t want to go to hell, but I wish I was dead. I feel completely empty, and I don’t really feel many emotions other than profound hopelessness and sadness. But I’m also worried I’m faking, becauae I have moments where I can be happy. I can forget how hopeless I feel. These moments make me worry that I’m faking these feelings. Any thoughts?",1

I’ve been dealing with this for 3 years now and i don’t know if it will ever get better. I thought maybe highschool was stressing me out but I’ve graduated last year and nothing changed. In fact everything has gotten worse. Nothing I do is good enough. Nothing I do works. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how much longer I can take this. At least my mom is around.

"so a couple days ago I made a post on here titled ""sooo, no one gives a shit"" where I talked about how no one really cares about me. Yesterday this was proven to be true. Not only did I already know the friends I had back home didn't care about me before I left for college (which is bearable, ill just find new ones), but my sister also told me that my own immediate family has been talking shit about me as im 200+ miles away and can't defend myself. All my life I have been the literal poster child for what an ideal kid is supposed to be. I got good grades, never failed a class, never talked back, helped everyone (and by help, I mean I was heavily parentified. if you wanna hear about that look on my page), I never partied, drinker, smoked, had sex, or even dated before I went to college, and some of that shit still stands. But my family is now painting me to be a horrible and disrespectful person for no reason, I don't even know what I did for them to think this way about me. I also find it funny how im so disrespectful and selfish, but little do they know the only reason im even still alive. I keep living BECAUSE of them and how much I don't want to disappoint and hurt them, despite them really knowing nothing about me because all my life I conformed to the version of me that they wanted me to be. I do EVERYTHING RIGHT and EVERYTHING FOR EVERYONE and I still manage to be no ones favorite person and painted as the bad guy. I've never even raised my voice at these people, despite all the shit they put me through (I have stories about things that I did in my childhood on my page that would literally make you think im the opposite of who they are painting me out to be. What makes it worse is in a week and a half, I have to go back home for thanksgiving and stay for a month. So I have to act like I don't know anything because god forbid I even try to bring something like this up to defend myself, all they would do is get loud, not listen, and tell me to get the fuck out. because of course, in a black family, the adult is always right (this coming from an 18 year old female, a legal adult). I don't even know how to feel or what to do. Part of me wants to create chaos when I get back but I have an overwhelming voice in my head telling me to heal, work my ass off in this higher education (that no one else in my family finished) and get to a place in my life where Im happy and stable enough to never have to speak to them again.",1

I thought I was being a decent person but am told I neglected, rejected, manipulated and am too freaking stubborn to hear any voice but my own.

This went on for a few year even after I entered school after primary school, eventually I started to lose friends because I had been acting using different personalities to suit different people. When the people who knew me as different things I became unstable because I didn’t know how to act because at this point I was a empty shell without those fabricated personalities, this is still to this day, I have completely forgotten what I was like before I started faking my entire personality. The worst thing I did during this is push away the people who actually noticed what I was going through, I can’t keep a new friendship with someone for more than a few interactions. The only reason I am confessing here is because the emotions I have been bottling up for years had been leaking out, I’ve been having mental breakdowns when I try to do homework, this has prevented me from doing the things I need to do.",1
"I hate myself. I feel worthless. But the cats seem to love me.
Humans tolerate me but animals comfort.",1
"i’ve tried to open up about something else too. i know how she reacts. she just forgets it eventually or tells me that “others have it worse”. either way, she never helps. just expects me to be happy. i’m grateful for the things she provides me but i just can’t “fake it till u make it” happiness.

my dad doesn’t give a shit either. probably will just try to be understanding and BULLY, INSULT AND ARGUE with my mom into getting me help. like what the fuck is up with that dude? he also constantly tries to gain my sympathy/pity because i sometimes make it apparent that i think he’s a cunt. my mom may be ignorant but at least she isn’t abusive lol

is there anything i can do for self help that’s sustainable? is self help even effective? idk. thanks in advance :)",1
Nothings redeemable about this life..... I can’t do this,1
"Over the past week I've felt incredibly empty. Today, minor issues finally got the better of me and my emotions changed from empty to extremely sad. I cried, but now that about-to-cry feeling is still there. Also, I now have physical symptoms. My head hurts/feels clouded, I mildly feel nauseous, and I'm not hungry, even though I haven't eaten in a few hours. If this persists by tomorrow, should I not go to school(college), even though I'm technically not really sick? Or should I go to school anyway, and tough it out? Would it get better if I just toughed it out? Also, should I do homework tonight if I feel this way?",1
"I think it's helping, I was really scared of taking meds for a long time but I got to the point I felt hopeless. my therapist recommended it and I kinda trust her, so now I'm trying to see how taking these goes.",1
"And I often wonder how many of those people are still alive.

We are barely equipped to help ourselves. And everything is so bleak.

"Sometimes, when the sun is too far gone to still be awake and I’m staring at my incomplete assignments in dread and exhaustion, I wonder if it's all worth it. It feels like I don’t belong in this place, full of academics with motivations and goals. I wonder how I ended up here, what kept me going when I truly want so little out of life, anyway. I guess I have a plan, sure, but I wouldn’t call it a dream, and it's certainly not a motivator. 

And I know nobody’s as perfect as they seem, that we’ve all got our own shit, but these people must have reasons, right? We all try so hard, spending days and nights in the libraries and studios, and it makes me wonder, what do they think about, when their French paper due tonight seems a lot less important than the prospect of finally relieving those bags under their eyes? When the sleep-deprived haze clouded over their minds pulls them away from their math work, what goals do they think of to power on? Because every time I stay up, I can’t help but ask why I keep going. And yet I always do. No matter how late it is, how heavy and dense that fog in my brain has become, I always complete the assignment. Yet I have no dreams, no driving desires. I even lack a higher power that might encourage my success. Maybe it's a fear of failure. Am I scared of the F that threatens to mar my career? Or could it be the looks of disappointment from my parents when I am not the best I could be? Sibling rivalry, academic validations, social reputation, perfectionism, it must be some twisted combination that is both so hindering and compelling, one that creates a terror in my bones every time I feel myself falling away from the person I wish everyone to see me as. But I don’t know if that’s even right, because I couldn’t tell you who I want to be. And I love learning, truly. I love how knowledge allows me to create, and grow, and understand, but I generally dislike school. I dislike being forced to learn truths I don’t care for, spending my youth working, and throwing away social connections for a grade. I don’t even know who I am, what I want, if I matter, or if mattering even really matters. 

I used to believe I understood who I was, making charts of my identity with things I enjoy and interests I pursue, but aren’t I something besides a messy collage of a million different hobbies and passions? I can’t define myself beyond the physical things I care for, and that scares me. Personality tests feel like a threat, every question challenging this notion of myself that is already so fragile. 

Morality plagues me. I feel as if I am always in the wrong or always have been, and I’m almost too afraid to commit to an idea for fear that I am just too ignorant to decide anything for myself. I used to be so stubborn, so sure of what was right or wrong, but now everything is gray and I feel like I always only have a piece of the puzzle. I can’t decide whether I wish I knew less, in order to return to that place of blissful ignorance and rigid morality, or if I should attempt to quench my desire to understand this place, to collect more pieces of this everlasting puzzle. Every question feels like a false dichotomy, and I often wonder if I am really anyone if I don’t believe in anything. 

So here I am, in college, and I do feel alone and lost, but I’m not quite tired of that yet. I think I spent far too much time with my life tied so closely to another’s that I lost track of myself. I spent a lot of this summer scared, and a lot of this fall confused. The people I’ve connected with here, I still keep behind thick walls of glass, letting them see enough to be considered friends, but not too much where they could break through, and the shards could cut me. I must be boring to be around, I probably seem detached or too much trouble to get close to. Or maybe I’m wrong, and I just can’t read the signs of interest that people have been sending. I feel like I am making friends, but then I am rarely invited, rarely texted, and easily forgotten. And I know it is my fault, for staying in on social days, and never answering their snapchats, and probably being annoying and awkward to be around in general. But I don’t understand them, how they spend an entire afternoon just chatting, and not wish to be back in the comfort of solitude. How they smile and talk so easily, like it takes as much effort as breathing. How they answer texts within minutes, call each other for hours, snapchat each other’s faces back and forth, and somehow gain so much emotional connection and fondness for the other from this. 

I can’t help but be the disappointment, the mess, the one you have to worry about, so sometimes I feel like the right thing to do is just to keep myself away where nobody will have to see my scars and stand under my raining cloud, because I’m sorry, but I forgot to bring that umbrella you always have to hide from your storm. 

And maybe that’s all bullshit, and I’m just falling for everyone’s shiny masks, but then why can’t I fake it like they can? Why does mine always spill over? Why do I over share? Why can’t I keep it inside? I can fake a smile and laugh it all off, but why can’t I push the heavy blanket of sadness off my back and respond to your texts? Why can’t I get past my own insecurities and exhaustion and reach out? 

I always wonder if everyone’s just better at pretending than me or the grass really is greener on the other side. I’m sick of getting dragged down by the same shit that I have for years. It feels as though I have failed to grow and I hate that. I don’t know who I am; I don’t know who I want to be. I cannot understand why you would want to hang out with me, because I do not understand who this person even is. Am I wasting my energy by even trying to figure it out? Should I just be enjoying what I can, pretending to care about the same things everyone else here does, or should I find what motivates me? I don’t know if I’ll ever know how to respond to these questions, or if there even is a response.",1
"It just makes me feel worse, because I can't just snap out of it. Then I feel bad because they feel bad because they couldn't make me not feel bad. It's all so stressful it makes me not want to reach out to people or be honest about what I'm going through.",1
Yup ik it’s over I can feel it in my spirit,1
"You ever get that need to just vent randomly to a bunch of strangers? That’s kind of how I feel right now, so here I am!

Life sucks man. Like really just seems not so great. It has its ups and downs but depression really just kicks your ass. I’m always on and off meds because I can’t keep up with going to the doctor due to work and my crippling anxiety of driving. I mean I do it to work and back but that’s about it.

Which is really weird to me. I used to drive literally everyone just for fun. I loved the hell out of it. Never got into an accident or anything, yet here I am. Absolutely terrified of having to drive. I literally will not go anywhere unless required. And if I do, I have to take all back roads and the least populated roads. So odd. But whatever.

Also at 26 or really anything after school, it sucks ass to make friends. I always post on Reddit looking for chats and such but they usually fizzle out. Which I mean I get. Everyone has their own lives and a stranger on the internet isn’t really priority. But it would be cool to make some IRL friends. It’s a long shot but whatever lol.

Work isn’t terrible but the hours suck. Getting up early and going to bed early is kind of a bummer. I’ve always played games as a hobby since I was super young. Now I don’t really have time. So all I do is maybe watch a little tv and go to bed.

Idk. Life’s just really eh lately. Not really a whole lot to look forward to. I usually just try my best to suppress the bad feelings and thoughts and put on a kind of fake face. Seems to work I suppose. But that’s life I guess.",1
"I truly have no will to do anything, nobody cares about me, nobody talks to me, the only time someone talks to me is when then need something from me mainly money. I’m so over it. I just want atleast one person to care but that won’t ever happen. I’m alone and it truly feels like I will be forever. Not even my quote “best friend” cares doesn’t even cares if I just vanish even family doesn’t care",1
"I have tried everything. I have made it as o virus to my teacher as I possibly could be. No medication, mental hospital, therapy, or psychiatrist has worked. I have become too depressed. Too far gone. I've become too suicide. Too worthless. I'm 15, 265 pounds, and autistic. I am failing most of my classes. I spend most of the days in my room alone. I can't do this anymore. What am I supposed to do? My social anxiety is too severe. What are my options?,",1
"I was doing better. Im in highschool and I technically live alone (18yrs old) and care for my two brothers. My dad works in the oil field so it’s okay I understand he can’t be here for us 24/7. My grandpa came and took us to the store to get groceries. I mentioned that I needed pads and my stomach was hurting. Once we got to the car to go home, my grandpa blew up on me calling me stupid saying I shouldn’t be talking about “that stuff” (he couldn’t even say the words period or pads). I said he was being a kid. He kept yelling at me until I started having a panic attack, and once I got home I went to my room and callled my dad. I tried to tell him what happened but i was still having a panic attack, He started screaming saying I have no reason to cry. Told me to shut up after I said sorry and said when my grandpa says anything to me to just suck it up. I really am sorry though, I didn’t mean to cause problems I don’t know what to do. I ended up just cutting my thighs after not cutting for 3 months. Sorry if there is a lot of grammar mistakes, I just wanted to vent.",1
"I've basically just ruined my relationship with the only girl I've ever really cared about because I'm just an overemotional retard who is incapable of actually just talking through my feelings.

I stopped taking my medication because I somehow can't find time to take 2 pills a day and now I'm just a bit of a mess.

Feel terrible and honestly don't know what to do. My mind's just flooded with stupid thoughts and I'd really appreciate somebody to talk to because I don't want to burden any of my friends.",1
"How do you deal with your friends freezing you out when you're depressed? 

Over the past 4-6 weeks, I've noticed the conversation with my best friends has fizzled, even though I've been quite open about struggling and needing someone to talk to. It's made me have to waste a lot of emotional energy wondering if I'm being paranoid or if they're intentionally leaving me behind, if I need to give them space or if I need to try harder. 

Last week, I called them out on it and asked what was going on. And they told me they'd been deliberately backing off because speaking to me was so stressful for them.

Obviously, the last thing I want to be is a burden to anyone. But I can't help feeling betrayed. These two people have been my best friends for 5 years and when I told them I was thinking a lot about dying, they acknowledged it with only a heart reaction and didn't speak to me for three days. I'm not sure if that's forgivable. 

If anyone else has been in a similar situation, did you fight to make it work? Or decided that you deserve better and to stop investing in an unfulfilling friendship?",1
idk I want to die but then again also just want a break so im hoping this will be just enough to make me pass out and wake up,1
"My problem is I’m not enjoying my favorite songs or tv show anymore. I just listened to all the songs that made me feel happy on endless repeat, and constantly watched the show back to back because it was the only thing that made me feel happy. But now that I’ve started to grow bored of them, I feel terrible. They were literally all I had left, and were the only things that could calm my anxiety. Is there anyway to enjoy them again? I just want to at least have some sort of escape, but other songs and shows don’t seem to effect me.",1
"Usually I just have a really rough patch maybe once a month where my depression is “severe” but the past few months it’s just the same thoughts &amp; feelings every single day and they just get worse and worse.

The only thing keeping me here is the thought of the effect me passing would have on her and my family. Is anybody in a similar situation or got out of something similar/have any tips/suggestions at all? I could really use some help",1
I don't want to cry anymore. I don't want to think about dying anymore. I just want to be happy. I want to be normal. I don't want to cry. I don't want to remember anything. I don't want to cry.,1
"I’ve had many difficult moments: sexually abused at 5 years old and never told, mom died of cancer in my early 20s, dad was cheating on her while she was sick and I knew it, younger sister was struggling with drugs and alcohol and tried to kill me with a knife after mom passed. Grew up poor, working to help pay the rent at home since I was 15. Men always used me for sex and never loved me. One of those, I got pregnant from and had a daughter as a single mom, who has my last name and is now in her early 20s. I put myself through school, always had a job, stayed away from drugs and got married later in life to a man who helped me raised my daughter since she was 10. My daughter’s father decided to be in her life and picked her up about once a month on the weekend and my sister seemed to have her life together after much struggle and adores my daughter as her own since she never had kids.
Three years ago, everything derailed. My sister, as I now realized, had been feeding my daughter hatred towards my husband and turning her against me. So had the father and his wife of about 10 years. My daughter, who was in college at the time (on my dime), decided to move into her father’s and to only have a distant relationship with me. A lot of hurtful things were said, which broke my heart. I became depressed when that happened 3 years ago and have never gotten better. The stepmother posts pictures on social media saying my daughter is her daughter, my sister calls me and talks for hours telling me that it is my fault that I lost my daughter and I deserve it, my husband tells me that it’s my fault for not having raised my daughter with more discipline and not telling her since she was small what an AH her father was. Husband sees me crying and calls me stupid and has no affection towards me. Actually, he left me now and says he wants a divorce.
I am all alone now in an apartment by myself after having raised a daughter and formed a family I loved and believed they loved me.
I can’t help think that I have to go back in time to get better, back to the moment it all derailed with my daughter coming back home from college instead of the father’s house.
I know I’m depressed, no desire to get out of bed or eat and getting away with it because I’m working from home. I have a couple of friends, who I muster up enough energy to seem fine to. I now see my daughter about once a month and I can lie to her too. And my sister is not local so she only pesters me on the phone, husband is not local either and very little communication while going through divorce. I refuse to get a therapist because there is so much energy I can muster up to fake being ok.
I think there is no future for me and no way to go back. So I wonder often about an elegant way to escape this life. I don’t think of suicide, but more of a way to not feel or think anymore. Like if I could spend all day in a meditative state for like the next few decades until I naturally die.
No hope here, and the divorce actually facilitates being able to easily transfer all I have to my daughter when I pass.
It feels like it is all lining up so I can easily leave my body at some point. Maybe the universe is telling me that I’m better than everyone around me and that I do deserve peace and not to suffer more through this existence.",1
"It's been 3 years since I've not met a single person apart from a few relatives. And of course the pandemic and the lockdown were cherry on top for my situation. Now I really don't like meeting people, I try to avoid them. And as a result I slowly started to loose my friends, now I don't have any. Yeah I've got a few online friends and they're really nice, but I can't technically meet them. I really hope as I grow older I will eventually come out from this void.

"Depressed as hell tonight; gonna grab my CBD vaporizer and take the trash out, then just stay outside in the cold and go for a walk by myself
 
I wish I could run away from everything, just like, detach from my body and fly someplace else like a leaf in the breeze 

As my anxiety gets helped by my meds, my depression seems to take its place

I also started taking 10mg of prozac.. ran out 2 days ago though... um so all week I have been falling back into my depressive ways.. not cleaning up after myself, wasting entirely too much time on social media mindlessly scrolling. It's been really hard to cope with the changes. Does anyone else feel this way? Also realized I should probably stop drinking too because it just makes everything worse. Fkin hate everything right now.. just need someone to relate with.",1
"TW: suicide 

So, long story short, I have Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety. I’ve suffered from both for a long time and the MDD diagnoses came through a few years ago. Since then I’ve been in therapy, but not medicated until a few weeks ago. 

Been going through a rough 18 months with Covid, a break up and having to do-parent my son from 700 miles because of my job, so my depression has been taken swings. Back at the end of September it got bad enough where I started recognizing that I was going down the slippery slope to suicide, so I self admitted into the psych ward to get back in control of my brain. I spent 6.5 days there, and but the end of it I felt good. While in, I was offered medicine, but I decided to decline and wait til I could see my therapist again to see what he thought about the whole thing (been seeing the same therapist for 2.5 years so I’m very particular about making sure he’s involved in my care if I get seen in an inpatient setting). 

Within 2 weeks of being released I released I realized that my depression was taking another low swing, and in session I finally asked to get some antidepressants. Went through the whole thing to get a prescriber (I am seen at a military hospital) and I finally got one at the beginning of this month. 

I started on Prozac about a week and a half ago, first at 10mg. I started to notice that I wasn’t quite feeling what I expected. I told my roommate that I felt as if I was getting worse, but we shook it off saying “oh, adjustment, it’s fine”.
This past Friday, I followed the instructions of my psychiatrist and went from 10 to 20mg. And I’ve now been starting to notice a bigger negative effect. I took a weekend trip with a big group (not something I normally do, but trying to put myself out there), and I noticed that my anxiety for most of it was very active, and my depression was taking some lower swings. 

Has anyone noticed that prozac has made them worse instead of better? How long was your adjustment period before you started to level out? I guess I expected to level out instead of get worse right away. 

I’m starting to worry that it’s not for me and I have another 4 weeks before I see my psychiatrist again, and I have to travel work work in that period of time and I don’t want to be a mess for work.",1
"Consider what a new and constantly evolving field psychology is.

Aaron T Beck has recently died. He founded Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, which has helped a countless number of people. It began to form and become practiced in the 1960’s

DBT was created not long after by a woman who had once suffered borderline personality disorder. If I was born anytime before then as someone with depression/ocd I’d have been screwed.

I have days where I have hope, and I have days where I don’t. Ever since my suicide attempts, I have been able to face the truth head on and no longer panic. Maybe because once you hit that point, nothing has that kind of power over you anymore. I also no longer react to jump scares.

And the truth I am seeing is, the type of therapy that might be out there to help me specifically might not exist yet. Do I have to be the one to invent it?

I do not believe in the just-world hypothesis. I believe there are people who will have amazing lives, people who will have depressing lives, and most people who will fall on the natural bell curve will be near the middle.

I wish I could trade places with someone who is living the shittiest life so they could appreciate the things that I have access to.

Please do not tell me it will get better, because the bell curve and true crime documentaries tell me some people just get f*****. And I’m actually coming to terms and acceptance with it.

I never want to write these things, as someone who suffers along side you, I don’t want to write anything here that will make you lose hope or dig you into a deeper hole.

But if we never write our true dark thoughts and utilized this space then it would probably be empty now wouldn’t it?

Maybe I’ll use CBT to reframe my thoughts. Is it all or nothing thinking, or fortune telling when I tell myself I will never get better? I forget the exact cognitive fallacy it falls under. Maybe both of them…

Rest In Peace Aaron Beck.",1
"I am so exhausted I don't want to exist anymore. I wish I knew how to describe how I act now but honestly, I can't because it doesn't make sense to me either and it's really embarrassing. I wish I could find it in the best possible way to summarize it but I feel I will never be able to. So in the middle of the pandemic, I became convinced that everything I touch or that exists is dirty and that may have Covid. So I started to constantly buy masks and gloves. I use gloves and tissues a lot and I feel like I need to use gloves to touch mos things even doorknobs to rooms in the house I live in. I wear masks in the house and anything I buy I use gloves to handle. I am convinced sometimes certain things got contaminated if they end up in certain areas of the floor in my room. Like earlier a few months I had a pile of clothes that were half my wardrobe on the floor and it was on the floor where I had a dress that I threw in that area of the floor after I went to a funeral. The pile of clothes happened to be in that area and so instead of washing I got frustrated and basically how dressed and half of my clothes to the garbage. So now I made myself struggle more and I have to go to wash because I have so little clothes that I run out a lot. I have to buy a separate box of gloves to even handle my clothes. I act like I'm cautious but the worse is that I let my room get so bad so nothing I do is making sense and idk how to stop it. Idk what I'm doing or what it is called but I feel so tired of myself and I can't stop and I never went through it before until now. It caused frustration with my family my mom told me to stop and ""grow up"". But I can't stop and I am aware the pandemic is not going away and all my efforts are what I do makes no sense and doesn't prevent anything but I can't stop.",1

The large majority of people once you get to know them openly admit they just want to die or at least stop existing. That in itself tells you how messed up the whole system is.

I’ve been working an amazing job with amazing benefits, I finally got over the whole last year of being with my abusive ex, I’ve been eating clean and working out, etc… However, I had a four day weekend. I spent three days alone. The first day off was good because my mom and I went out of town on a little shopping trip. However, this guy I was supposed to go on a date with blew me off and my only friend that lives by me was working all weekend. I could’ve called up people to go out with but they’re only drinking friends which I don’t do that much of anymore. It hit me when I was going to the gym for the second time on Friday night… I’m depressed. I should be out with friends, family, or on a date. But I chose to be alone. Anytime I choose to be alone is the indicator of depression for me. I’m quite introverted but I love being surrounded by people that I WANT to be surrounded by. Today I cried a lot. Scrolling through Instagram seeing everyone having the time of their lives didn’t help my case. I just feel alone. I feel like people don’t care about me like they used to.",1

Why do people make me feel that i am talking out of world things because of which they ignore me and i am sick of it i really need people to talk to me i am so lonely , there has been times when i use to stay lonely for weeks without any human interaction wtf is wrong with everybody...",1
"This is probably the wrong forum to write this on. Lately I’ve been feeling like im a burden because of me having a learning disability , And mental health issues. Everyone that I have lived with (Family wise) has always hated me , Even though when it came to money everyone always came to me for it. My learning disability has caused me so much pain &amp; trouble , People have literally made fun of me behind my back and I can hear it. I deeply think I’ll be better off just “Offing” myself because at the end of the day , What can people truly say? That “I’m well liked? People loved me? I lit up a room when I walked in it?” If they did say that they’d be lying. My own family won’t even call me to see how I’m doing , No one checks up on me except my best friend (When she’s not busy) Sometimes it’s me that rarely ever talk to her because I don’t like bringing my problems on to other people. Let’s just say that I want to give up on life sometimes because what’s the point of living if everyone around me show me how much of a burden I am?",1
"wow!! its been a while since i felt so bad about everything! i can’t really believe it but like i really am worrying about myself again. i don’t have depression but i really really hate myself which is not ideal 😕

i think my best friend is slowly starting to dislike me (and i honestly don’t blame him) because i took a week off to revise for my exams and then another week off to try and better myself but i completely was trying to focus on myself i let him down and only messaged him once like every 4 days. i have a tendency to neglect all of my friends when i’m trying to do stuff for some reason and it’s no wonder he probably is starting to forget about me already but it’s totally okay :)

i talk to him daily again but i still feel pretty empty!! planning my future is tough and balancing my life is even harder! also i kinda have a tiny tiny tiny hunch that my best friend’s new boyfriend kinda hates me secretly??? but i haven’t thought that much into it which is good!!!! 

but yep!!! who would have guessed it! but my suicidal arc is starting yet again 😎 and i am doing pretty pretty bad!!!! i’m probably overreacting and my hormones are probably going crazy or something like every other teen but like- it’s ok right!! hopefully? we’ll see 😌😌",1
Like the chemicals aren’t there..wtf is wrong w me?!? I have no reason to be this way,1
"I think its hilarious that I get labeled the bad guy when I get angry when a woman ghosts or rejects me. It starts of nice and Im polite and kind(like anyone should be) but the next day or week, she doesn't answer my messages. Rejecting me is one thing(that I hate) but ghosting me just prove how rude a lot of women are by just ignoring me without yet so much as a fucking reason. Tell me, why do you ignore me? Is it really that Im a deformed beast or is it that my intellectual pursuits are too boring compared to the men you chose over me. I deserve a fucking explanation. Also, why the fuck do people younger than me have better success with dating than me, what kind of joke is that. At this point I despise the women that rejected me, the dudes they're with and any person who is considered better looking than me. Life sucks and Im probably gonna chemically castrate myself",1

"Or anyone I know tbh. 
I attempted suicide this year, and only 4 people know. But I get the impression that they think I'm okay now. Or maybe they're trying to convince themselves that I'm okay. I don't know. 

They obviously suggested I get therapy, or go on meds. But I don't want to. 

It's bittersweet. Because when certain phrases are said, he doesn't seem to understand when I take it differently. Example: if he says he hates himself, I get extremely worried and ask him to go into detail. He's just like ""what? I'm only joking. Are you okay??"". He just doesn't get it. BUT, it's bittersweet because I'm glad he doesn't understand it. I'm glad he isn't as messed up as me!",1

"Lately I’ve either been feeling so much or nothing at all. More of the latter than the former. But what’s really bothering me is the fact that I have absolutely no feelings towards myself. Like yeah, I might feel and think that I’m a failure in a lot of aspects, but other times, and most times, I feel like I’m nothing. As if I’m not even human anymore. Who’s brushing their teeth? Who’s pouring coffee in the mug? Who’s hands are these that are holding a pencil? Surely it can’t be me. Surely I can’t be a real, breathing human being. I think this is something that no one can really understand until they experience it. Because I don’t know how many times I’ve tried to express how nothing feels real, am I dreaming right now? To so many of my friends to only receive blank stares or confused expressions back. I don’t like this jail cell. When will the day come where I can breathe and live in a body that feels mine. I should’ve never taken the good days for granted. When will they come back to me?",1
"Carl Jung described it as ones ""shadow""

Freud coined it as the ""id""

The ""yang"" to your ""ying""

The ""monkey brain"" to your human 

Inside me lies a shadow, my darkest fears always behind me, even at my brightest times and darkest moments. 

I look into the abyss and freeze in fear of what looks back at me. 

I feel it loom over me day in, day out. When I'm aware, she is beside me and when I repress it, she consumes me. 

When I call for her there is silence and when there's silence she's screaming

Some days I feel like a shadow to this void, only left as a voice crying far away and unheard 

Other days the shadow speaks for me, thinks for me, lives for me 

To face one's shadow is an act of courage which I lack 

For now, I am chained and in darkness until she grows tired again",1
"I’m a 32 black female and important here to mention race as it has played a crucial role in my mental health journey. My mom in particular didn’t understand how or why I could be depression and feeling so many emotions out my control. It’s very taboo in the black community to not seek out help and to pray about it. 
Over the past 4 years with me being in therapy, she finally gets it. Or so I think and hope. 

Now to the last couple of days, where something happened and I lost my shit mentally, I decided if I don’t take the plunge and get on meds, the worst was finally going to happen. Suicide. 

I never want to hurt my parents obviously but in all reality, they’re opinion was contributing to me hurting. 

Help me decide on Prozac or Zoloft. Pros, cons, side effects, etc and if you have similar experiences with race and mental health. Thanks!",1
"Hi I am a 22 y/o male and im going through rough times right now. Ive been on many antidepressants since the age of 14 (zoloft 150, paxil 40, wellbutrin 150, trintellix 15). I honestly feel like antidepressants made me go over some things but also messed up some parts of my life. Ive tried so many times to tapper off of them but I just failed everytime. It messed up my sex drive and relationships for the past 8 years of my life. Im currently on 15mg Trintellix and im not feeling any better right now. Im just kind of hopeless honestly. I keep feeling extremely terrible over and over again for no reason. Im fixing some stuff up in my life but I keep having these extreme lows of depression and anxiety even with medication. It wasnt the case before. I used to be fine on antidepressants but now the numbing is not enough and it surfaces through. I got no one to talk about it. Actually I do but im just too introvert and anxious to talk about any of this with anyone. I really feel trapped and alone and it’s the worse. I hope it get’s better I want to live my life… Ive put myself in a terrible financial situation which I am slowly recovering from. I still haven’t got over my ex and it’s been over 3 years. Our relationship went bad mostly because of the sexual dysfunction from antidepressants. Covid ruined the little bit of hope I had to be an adult and have a job (I studied for a year and then covid struck right away and I just didn’t pursue anything in that lane afterwards). And I guess theres more but Ill stop there you get the idea. It just gets worse and it affects my self esteem. I tell myself horrible stuff like I won’t be able to be normal ever and I will need to numb myself for my whole life. Or I will never know love even tho it’s what I desire the most. I need help but it just feels like theres no help in this world. I see a therapist and it kind of helps but I just keep getting deeper into it and idk what to do. That’s pretty much it … thank you if you have read this.",1

"I went out today. Everything was nice till I start getting triggered by my own thoughts. I'm not a likable person. Lost more friends than I could count and only have one friend who's not close so I'm scared to see people I know so I become a hermit. I can't get a job and when I do, I can't function well enough to do a good job. 

I only go outside if there's a friend coming with me and even then, it makes me realize how lonely I really am. Anime and video games make me happy and makes me feel like I'm part of a community but I can't even make online friends. I lose them too. 

I don't want to be alone but I'm scared of people. They scare me. I can't communicate well and people tell me that when they had enough of me. I ruined my chance of getting a job at this place because of it. 

I'm not worth it. I want to stay home. I can't function and go outside. Going to places alone bore me too. I can't go to places without feeling uncomfortable, unsafe, or bored to the point I have to beg my family to get out of where we are. I need a friend or music to feel somewhat safe but at the same time...

I just ruin that too.",1

Man stfu, I agree that there are people in worst situations than me but to say that I should not complain is BS. We have the right to complain, Some people in worst situations than me have the will to live, and that's a fact, but another fact is that I don't have their will to live anymore. Just because I have the ability to start making my life better and some don't does not mean that's a good advice.

"I’ve been depressed for a few years now, and it comes in waves. It seems like sometimes it’s a result of some small thing that gets me extremely emotional, or (most of the time) it just comes in waves out of nowhere and is a self propelling illness. I’ll be depressed for a time and won’t be able to get out of bed, then I end up getting more depressed since I’ve been in bed the whole day and feel like a failure, etc. The problem is, I’m reaching out for help but am having trouble explaining what’s wrong. I know something is off, life has lost its color and nothing is worth the energy anymore, but I couldn’t tell you why. Most mental health evaluations ask what’s wrong as a first step, and it seems like something is just fundamentally wrong with me because I don’t know how I got here. Even in times in my life when I had a life and was active in the world, I would have a nagging at me that brought me down when I was alone. My head is never quiet, but I’ve never been able to pinpoint where on earth this is all coming from. It’s pretty frustrating to be honest.",1
"I'm so sick of life. I don't know what to do anymore. 

I'm not getting any mental health help. Everyone argues multiple times a day. We moved like 2 months ago so don't have a psychologist/councillor or anything like that and we don't have a social worker. I told my mum i need one but the gp is always full so i cant get a referral.

Mum's at work all day and i'm stuck with only my Father who i hate for 5 days a week and my whole family on weekends so i never get a break from him.. Most days i wake up to Him shouting at my sister or my sister shouting at him. He doesn't respect privacy, keeps going into my sisters room without knocking then refuses to leave so they shout even more. To my door he sometimes knocks but never waits and refuses to close my door or let me close it. It's infuriating and i don't want to interact with him.

Its hard finding a job here so My parents are talking about moving.. again.. We finally found an ok house and unpacked nearly everything and they are talking about moving. We might not move if they manage to find a job but idk..

I hate this. I hate my life. I'm just having one mental breakdown after another, one depressive episode after another, one urge after another.

We finally at least have a nice house and now I'm going to be stressing about this again. 

With every argument i just want to either kill HIM or myself.",1
"Today I bought some tacos from my favorite taco truck that’s been around forever, since I was a kid my parents would take us there Friday or Saturday nights. Those tacos hit better than any blunt I’ve ever smoked. 

I took a bite and I almost broke down right there in front of the truck. I lost all motivation the second the bite was done. I couldn’t even chew it. It tastes the same as always and I couldn’t take another bite. It seemed like if I did and continued I was going to lose one of the only good memories I had as a kid. I’ve come to my own conclusion that food is mostly a passion of the poor. Rich people are mostly skinny cause they got other good shit going on in their lives and food is just something they HAVE to do that takes them away from all the other cool shit their doing.

Well I grew up poor, my mothers food was the highlight of my day most times. She couldn’t provide much but her cooking was better than any restaurant I’ve ever been too. And now depression is taking away my love for food.",1

"(Im French sorry for my bad English)
I've been in depression for quite a while, but I've always managed to hide it (even from myself). But recently I can't do it anymore. I can't get anywhere. I hardly go to class anymore because no one is expecting me.
One night I went out with my two best friends and being a little drunk I told them that I felt alone and that I needed to see them more often. But that hasn't changed anything, we still see each other as much as before, that is to say once a week. All the rest of the week I'm alone in my apartment.
A few weeks later on another evening and still drunk (this time I was on the verge of an alcoholic coma), I started to cry and confess a lot of my problems and one of the two me. accompanied. I didn't want to talk about it but, I think I couldn't bear to imagine myself admitting my problems to them and imagining them to me.
comfort me, I wanted it to come true.
But again, it didn't work since I learned that one of them was upset and disappointed with me because I prevented her from fully enjoying her evening and that she would have preferred to stay at her place. rather than go through it.
Now there is something unspoken between us and no one dares to broach the subject so I am alone again and feel even worse. I don’t know what to do. I'm just tired.",1

"Hey to whoever is reading this. It's been a tough time for everyone around, I believe it, I just had to get this off my chest, maybe someone will read it too.
I've been suffering from overthinking, anxiety, social anxiety, OCD, and mostly depression really since 2019. It's been hard dealing with that kind of stuff, knowing that I was verbally bullied since elementary school, I've been carrying that since then. Most of us escape from those kind of problems through music. I started writing music, started drawing and writing my own texts, and that would impress some people that were around. That helped me, until some point of time where I felt so useless, worthless. Have you ever got to the point where you are sooo down, that you're afraid if this is not the deepest I've been, what's deeper than this? I cried every night, and I'm not afraid of saying that, nor am I ashamed. I'm bout to turn 18 in less than month and a half, I'm a guy. I'm seeing people celebrating their birthdays and enjoying their times, their best moments, posting it on socials and stuff, that just breaks me, cause I never was happy when my birthday came around. I tried deleting socials to try becoming better and I doubted myself too much. I doubt myself now as well. It helped, until some point where I know that I need attention, cause I never felt real love, I never felt real friendship, cause most of the kids in elementary and high school right now don't want to hang out, cause I'm too weird. I'm just trying to be myself. I don't let out my problems to any of my family members cause I don't want them to know anything about my mental health. To be honest, the only thing I really wanted is a little bit respect, love, attention and someone that will take me for granted, for who I am. I'm dying inside cause of it. I don't get support, I don't feel emotions, I don't want to smile, don't want to talk nor be here anymore. I never had suicidal thoughts, I never wanted to kill myself, I just want some rest from everything around me. I've stopped writing music and texts, can't draw anymore, I just feel like I've been coming down to the point where I'm going to stop doing anything and crumble and fall even more into it. Although I still have something telling me not to quit. I don't want to quit, and yet, I do. The only thing that's keeping me into this ""hope"" that I barely feel is around is a person that I love and that came back to my life after I messed up, she gave me another shot and that made me think some things through. I have problems with that too, cause I just want some time with her, but it's hardly possible, and that comes to my questioning, if she cares, she'll make a little bit of time. It's to the point where I overthink these things as well. Too many problems. I don't want to act cold to anyone, I don't want to show no emotion, to show my pain, I just want myself to be normal like I was before. I miss being myself, I miss being loved and a lot of stuff too. My birthday is coming and I just want it to pass by, cause I know that day, I'll cry my soul out until I fall asleep and stop crying. 
Thank you for reading this, for anyone reading this, I just wanted to get some stuff off my chest and it kind of helped.",1

He then threatens to destroy my things like my phone, computer, and speakers. My computer is my only way to escape from him, and whenever he sees me on it he threatens to hit me and throw it into our pool.

I try to do everything to please him but none of it ever works. I swept an entire 8000 square foot shop in 2 hrs to try to make him not hate me but he just said that he could have done it in 30 minutes while all he did was clean a staircase in the same amount of time.

"Ça fait pas mal de temps que je suis déprimée/dépressive mais j’ai toujours réussi à le cacher (même à moi-même). Mais récemment je n’y arrive plus. Je n’arrive plus à rien. Je ne vais presque plus en cours car personne ne m’y attend.

Un soir je suis sortie avec mes deux meilleures amies et étant un peu bourrée je leur est avoué que je me sentais seule et que j’avais besoin de les voir plus souvent. Mais ça n’a rien changé, on se voit toujours autant qu’avant, c’est à dire 1 fois par semaine. Tout le reste de la semaine je suis seule dans mon appartement. Je travaille que quand je n’ai plus le choix.

Quelques semaines plus tard lors d’une autre soirée et encore bourrée (cette fois-ci j’étais à deux doigts du coma éthylique), je me suis mise à pleurer et avouer beaucoup de mes problèmes et l’une des deux m’a accompagnée. Je ne voulais pas en parler mais je crois que je n’en pouvais plus de m’imaginer en train de leur avouer mes problemes et qu’elles me réconforte, je crois que je voulais que ça devienne réel. 

Mais encore ça n’a pas marcher puisque que j’ai appris que l’une des deux était énervée et déçue de moi car je l’ai empêché de profiter pleinement de sa soirée et qu’elle aurait préféré rester chez elle plutôt que de me voir avouer mes problèmes.

I’m almost on the last episode. I ordered bbq chicken wings. They were good.” Others go “today was a good day. I hung out with my friend. We went downtown and rode the electric scooter. It was fun. I enjoyed today.” My life is really boring. Sometimes I talk about heartbreak but most of the time I’m just talking about how I want to die. Should I continue to write or just stop?,1

The one person that swears they know me so well. I think about unsubscribing from life ALL DAY EVERY DAY. I’ve attempted multiple times over the years. Should’ve done the trick, still wake up the next day. I’m seriously contemplating getting some fent and oding. Feels like everyone would be better off if I wasn’t here.",1
i went to this family friends house and we finally admitted that we used to have a crush on each other a few years ago. he’s done a lot of things with girls and i’ve barely done anything despite being older than him lol. so it was nice to know that at some point in my life there was someone who found me attractive and wanted to talk/be with me. this is happened twice in my life and i know i should not be basing my worth on other ppl but i can’t help it. it made me feel like wow maybe i’m not so unlovable and ugly after all cos there was 2 ppl in my entire life that kind of liked me. and he kind of flirted with me today but i was too shy to like do anything abt it lol. i wish i was more confident and didn’t rely on men for validation fhfhfhd. i also wish that i saw myself as pretty or attractive. idk i hate that i fall for like everyone tho. like literally he gave the tiniest bit of attention and here i am thinking and smiling abt it hours later. he’s not even that great of person. he’s like borderline misogynistic and lowkey homophobic. which should be like a turnoff cos wtf but i’m annoying snd fall for shitty ppl anyways fhfhdb,1

Do you ever wake up from a dream and just wish you could have stayed asleep forever? I certainly do. In my dream I was actually happy and had a girl who actually cared about me. But I woke up and now I want nothing more than to just go back to sleep and continue my dream forever because I know I will never be even close to as happy as I was while I was dreaming. Shit sucks.,1

I'm not good enough for anyone. I'm constantly questioning my self worth. I'm constantly questioning if I can ever be fully loved, if I'm good enough to keep someone happy.

I need someone to tell me everyday that I'm worth it and that I'm something.

A few weeks ago I decided that if my life wouldnt have gotten better, the 12 october 2022 I would have killed myself, I dont think i can last that long, so ive set up a new date (21 november 2021). First im gonna talk to my father and i will choose what to do (kill my self or try another few months) based on is reaction.

I don't need help (specially things like ""It's gonna get better""), i just wanted to tell someone",1

My boyfriend has depression, otsd and an ED. The last few weeks have been especially hard for him, he‘s been missing school, has started drinking alone again and saying really „scary“ shit. I‘m trying my very, very best to help him but i just feel so hopeless sometimes. I‘m aware that his mental health has nothing to do with me personally and that i can‘t love someones depression away, but i feel like nothing i do helps and that all i can do is just watch. He does go to therapy and he‘s trying his hardest to get better and i know how hard it is for him and i‘m really fucking proud of him but i just can‘t stop worrying. My absolute biggest fear is him comitting suicide, just thinking about it makes me panic. I don‘t think i could go on if he ever lost this battle. Like i actually can’t imagine i could go on with my life, and the worst thing is knowing how little i can actually do to prevent that. I wish i could take his pain away and make him realize what an amazing person he is and how much he truly deserves.

I dont know how to handle these feelings of hopelesness and fear and worry and not being able to talk about this with him makes this worse. I just want to be sure he‘s going to be okay, that‘s all i truly want.",1
"I was raised very old school by my bigoted grandparents so for me to come out and ask for help is very hard but I did. I told my mother that I'm very depressed and have extreme mood swings which is normal for a teen but not this extreme and the extreme happy moods which can turn into a suicidal mood within a day I don't think it's normal. So I told my mother and her knowing that bipolar disorder and other disorders run rampant in my father's side of the family decided to do nothing. I don't quite blame her because we wouldn't even be able to afford it if we did do something.So the shame for telling her everything so I could maybe finally get some help was for nothing.ive alsoq tried reaching out at school but its still in my mom's hands. Now I don't know what to do I can't keep going like this I can't play Russian roulette every morning to see if I'm suicidal happy or just depressed and the happy days aren't very common.

So here's where I need some advice. I'm thinking about admitting myself in a psych ward for contemplating suicide. At least then my mental health wouldn't be put in my mother's hands and the waiting time would be gone and it wouldn't put us in financial risk. And not like I'd be lying I really do consider suicide most days. I obviously know it's not gonna be a vacation but I've been put in terrible places for my own good hence why I lived with my bigoted grandparents. Do you guys think this is a good idea? Or bad? Or do you guys have any other ideas?",1
"(I'm french so be kind if i do english mistakes)
So in January 2022, I will be 20 years old and my life sucks, I'm a straight man and I never had a girlfriend,never kissed a girl..., I don't really know what I want to be later (I'm doing informatics studies but staying in front of a wall of text on a computer is depressing itself).

I'm seeing a psychologist since 4 months but it's still getting worse. I'm always sad and angry about my whole life, and I often compare my life to others (which I know is stupid but it hurts me a lot) and I'm jealous which leads to more hate, I'm just asking ""why me"", ""why my life is not like others"", ""what did I do to be here""... 

My psycholigist says that with my appearence I should have no difficulty finding a gf, and even tho I hate to admit it, it's kinda true, but I just don't want to accept the fact that I ""failed"" even tho I had everything to ""win"" (I'm not confident enough to talk to a girl I don't know). I signed up on a lot of apps to find some girls to talk and after all my efforts on that, I get ignored by the few girls who matched with me, which cause more sadness/hate.

I hate myself, I hate everyone, I hate god who decides to bully me(if he exists, I'm agnostic)...",1
"What would do the least amount of damage? I used to cut myself, but now I will mostly just choke myself until my vision goes out or punch my head. I find the asphyxiation to be euphoric and provides a VERY strong sense of dissociation which I thoroughly enjoy. I've read that brain cells start to die after oxygen supply is cut off around \~5 minutes, and while I am not going to say that these choking sessions are NOT harmful, I am not going near 5 minutes (probably around 30 seconds max). If I were to only continue one of these behaviors, which one would be preferable and why? Thanks!",1
"I've had depression since I was 15 and developed and severe eating disorder. To which even now, 4 years recovered, whenever people close to me during that time or my family see me they still always comment on me ""looking healthy"" and not ""scrawny/ghostly looking anymore"". It doesn't bother me so much anymore because even though I still struggle intensely with body image issues, it just shows people will forever worry about me in that aspect and I wish they would stop.
But recently I recently broke up with my boyfriend and it's made me reflect on some things. When I was 16 I was in a ""relationship"" with someone twice my age and it really messed me up. I didn't even realise it messed me up until I experienced a natural disaster when living in japan. I guess I was used to not trusting anyone around me but after that I couldn't even trust the ground under my feet and I was still getting sick if I was upstairs and the floor shook a little bit (like if someone runs upstairs or something) even after I moved back to England where an earthquake would never happen. Last year I reported what happened to me during that ""relationship"" and I had interviews but I guess it got lost in the system and my victim support counsellor the police provided me told me unfortunately thats what happens to ""historic cases"" because current abuse cases and missing people cases are put first. I went from anorexia and a horrible abusive relationship to moving to Japan at 20 and instantly getting into a relationship with a Japanese guy and I guess all the fun and cultural difference distracted me, but this guy also had many many problems and was abused by his father but because of Japan's view on mental health he never addressed how it affects him. I ended up ending the relationship after he moved to England. I don't really remember why. He was a still a student and I was working and our lives had really changed and it was just time things ended. I said something really horrible to him when he kept saying he wanted to be best friends and wanted me wait for him and stuff. I told him he was exactly like his father and would end up in a relationship like his parents. Its probably the worst thing I've said. I said it to purposefully hurt him and make him leave me alone. and it still eats at me and I wish I could tell him I didn't mean it. But obviously I just hope he has forgotten and is living a very successful life. Which I know he is, he is a very smart guy. After this relationship I moved way to fast into another relationship with someone I met on VR. He made me feel wonderful. He would say things that made me feel so loved and forgiven. He has very very many issues. Not leaving the house was one of them. We ended up moving WAY too fast and moved in only after 2 weeks of meeting each other in person, Then a week later. We were in lockdown. I guess what I'm failing to mention is that I put all of myself into wanting to fix these guys. And wanted to show them know how beautiful life can be despite the horrible suffering we feel. I failed. I tried my best but I made things worse. And now I'm too upset to even write about it. But today his mother messaged me asking for his box back and his laptop back. I said I didn't have his laptop but she kept saying I did. I said I didn't appreciate being accused of taking his laptop. and in reply she said some very nasty things. It made me feel so low that I self harmed. It hurts. Especially because the only reason she went to see him today was because I begged her to check on him because I was worried about him. Not because she chose to from her own thoughts. And in return I got belittled and it made me feel so fucking low.",1

"A vent/rant

Spontaneous waves of sadness and crying, sometimes sobbing. The “waves” are so intense it’s ridiculous, my chest gets tight, it felt like the walls are closing in. I just want it to stop, when I think it does, the tears come again. Sometimes my mind starts to panic, worry excessively. Anxiety about going to work, about doing this or not doing that. These thoughts can be panic inducing, then triggering a panic attack (which Sam helped me avoid that type of meltdown) which is the last thing I want. When I have panic attacks, usually feels like im going to die. 

So…why am I crying or sad today? Truth is I have no idea. With clinical depression, even when you’re happy, these episodes can still happen. It’s due to chemical imbalances in my brain. Currently trying to distract my brain/mind so it can focus on other things. Going outside helps, but the sudden wave of crying isn’t fun in public. I want and need to be more active, but when your body is telling you not to move or that we don’t have enough “spoons” it’s hard to gain an ounce of strength to work out. Soon tho, I will be able to get to that point. 

I’ve been living like this for so long I’m almost used to it, but still sucks all the same. Most wouldn’t think my mental illnesses are this bad because I don’t show it. I “fake it until I make it” or I’d never even make it to work. 

Thought I’d share this in case anyone else is suffering too, know that you are not alone. Also for others to maybe understand what some of us go through when we say we are depressed or have anxiety. 
 
I am resilient and strong, and I will overcome this ✨

"Today, 3 days before my 21st birthday, my dad told me to leave and never return to his home, along aside that he’s with held important information from me that I just found out today… here’s my story.. For the past two months I have been struggling to pay bills, and although I didn’t ask for (or wanted and you’ll soon know why) to help, my step mom noticed and she helped me by giving me money to pay off somethings. Well within this last week, she’s been picking at my skin and making me feel like a disappointment for not making it perfectly out on my own. Normally I’d bite my tongue and ignore it, but just yesterday she crossed my last line and I couldn’t take it anymore. I popped back at her and when she proceed to tell me I was nothing but like my biological mother (who is a drug addict who’s made a lot of bad mistakes and is sitting on her death bed rn) I got up and left. I had no means to talk to them again after this. This women tried to rip my eyes out of my skull on my 19th birthday, and last Christmas she slammed me into a semi truck. My last straw was broken and I wanted to not ever go back in hopes that my dad would see the pain I’m in. Well just that night, I came home to find my cat…my only best friend…had been killed. With that I had no choice but to tell my dad, for I live in an apartment complex and have no money to cremate him or no place to bury them. He told me to bring him this morning to bury and I did, with the plan to go and to leave ASAP. Well as my dad was digging he told me I needed to apologize to my step mom..with that I refused and everything escalated from there. He took her side once again on things, he told me that she didn’t have to apologize and that I was just playing the blame game again and that I was being an ungrateful child. Even though, all of this started because she was making me feel like a piece of shit once again and not regarding my mentality or emotions. Well before I left the last thing he said to me was to never come back…and on my way back home my step mom started blowing up my phone and harassing me. Within everything she had to say which nothing was nice at all, she told me that back in 2013 I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and that I’ve been nothing but the perfect victim my entire life. It’s now 2021…they have with held this information from me for almost a decade… they told me I was took out of therapy because it was a waste of money..and they did nothing to help me. I was told constantly that my feelings meant nothing that I was over reacting and ungrateful and even stupid… and After knowing this…I’ve come to the realization that after all these years of just wanting my dad because he up and left two years before “to make a better life for me” he never gave a shit in the first place. He found a new woman…and ever since then all this has been just a big fuck you. I’ve now learned that just because he’s your dad, it doesn’t mean he actually cares about you…",1

"I don't even know where to start, probably when this started. I was diagnosed with chronic depression since I was 14 years old (I am currently 26), and there were some moments, some months were wasn't bad, but each time this comes back it is stronger and more harmful ... The first time was with the thoughts, you know what thoughts, they scared me a lot (I think they still do) and strangely enough, they came with dreams that I was dying every night. So I started taking sleeping pills. The next time that happened, I was more aggressive towards myself, hurting myself in a way that no one else could notice and that was scary too, but it did happen. The third time I putted myself in dangerous places letting bad things happen to me around some ppl just so I wouldn't feel lonely for a while.

Now I can't sleep, the drugs don't work anymore and it's too much for my body, so I don't want anything else when comes to pills and I'm not even eating.

The thing is, I can feel like this will come back soon and I'm not sure what can happen or if I want it to happen, I really don't, but I just let it happen every time before this. But what if this time is all together and I have no control over it? I'm so scared.

"So i came up with an idea to by get over wanting a Girlfriend heres how it works and tell me what you guys think about it.
I call it “The Hard Truth”
Every time i see a girl i think is attractive,I’ll instantly say to myself in my head or if i can say it verbally ~“she’s too gud for you .You don’t deserve her.
My hypothesis is that ill turn off the “want” to have a girlfriend in my subconscious mind by telling myself im not good enough for one every time i see one.i think it can work with constant repetition but I also wonder will it instead cause crippling depression…
Is my idea of self mentoring any good or is there a flaw i may be missing!",1
"This is just a vent, if anyone has advice or support, thanks in advance. 

I’ve been having a terrible 5 month episode that doesn’t seem to have any end and has been getting worse and worse as times goes on. 

No matter what it seems like I basically have to beg people to talk to me or interact with me. It’s hard to feel good about yourself or like you have friends when your phone is basically silent all day, but everyone around you is constantly getting go home calls or texting their friends. Even new people I’ve met, and made connections with, don’t reach out to me. It’s a problem I’ve had basically my whole life, I remember having this problem even as a child. 

Everyone’s advice is “keep reaching out” but they don’t understand that depression makes doing that impossible. I also feel like what’s the point if I have to always be the one to reach out first AND be the one to keep the conversation going? Why is socializing and maintaining relationships so much easier for everyone else? 

I don’t even see the point in perusing my hobbies and interests, cuz what’s the point if I still feel miserable when doing them?

I’m not a an asshole or anything, I like to think I have a good personality and am interesting, but for some reason I’ve always felt a disconnect from people, or that I’m just a second option. Lately it’s even felt like I’m a second option to my long-term girlfriend",1

"I go through phases of being high and low which can last from a week to a month and the low phases are really taking an effect on my daily life, relationships, and socialising. When I feel like I’m in a high phase I enjoy life so much more, but when I’m low I just don’t enjoy life at all, I rarely feel suicidal but it’s just the other symptoms that come with it which are hard to cope with and I want to know what people think it could be so I can get put on the right medication, I’m starting CBT therapy soon but with me being in a low phase currently I don’t feel like it’s going to work I just want to stop feeling low and either feel high or just normal constantly. 

I know when I’m going into a low phase when I stop starting conversations with people like my mates I’ll just send blank photos on Snapchat and I’ll post less on my private story and I’ll just start to think that I have nothing to look forward too and then it will just get worse from there. I’m tired throughout the day no matter how much I’ve slept and caffeine doesn’t give me the same ‘feel good’ effect, I won’t laugh at things which I usually would find funny. Usually I’ll just be speaking to one person whether it’s my close close mate or my ex girlfriend (when I was with her) but then I get dependant on them to speak to me and because I start thinking negatively, things will bother me more such as when I’m not getting much attention off them and my anger levels go higher to people I’m closest to and I’ll argue with them over tiny things, and because of my stubbornness I will argue for hours until they give up (my ex used to just say she was wrong so that I’d stop arguing but it pissed me off even more because I knew she was just saying it). I think negatively of everything when I feel like this and it stops me from doing things I did before. I’ll start giving blunt replies to people I usually speak to because I can’t really be bothered thinking of a conversation to have and it just goes worse from there.

After a while of feeling like this I’ll slowly start to be more social and I’ll feel like there is more to life to look forwards to and my confidence starts getting higher and I start speaking to the people I ignored when I was low and I start to find things more funny and I can have jokes with my mates, I won’t feel anywhere near as tired anymore (no matter how much I’ve slept) and I start to make plans with my mates and go to the gym again, I do feel on top of the world sometimes as in I’m just happy with how everything is going, things don’t bother me as much like if something annoys me I won’t dwell on it and cause a long-drawn argument. 

I’m just done with this all now I want to feel normal it’s been effecting me for years and I can’t take feeling low anymore it’s pushed me away from both of my exes and I have lost out on a few good friendships because of this. I have a feeling it could be bipolar but I don’t know if it’s as severe as that, after searching on Google I found out it could be cyclothymia as this matches my description the best way possible. Will CBT or medication fix my issue or not because I seriously can’t take this any longer I just want to be happy all the time.",1
"I have been struggling for the past few weeks. Between my responsibilities and having a hard time finding a new therapist, I have been really struggling to get by. I am usually able to get through things and then go home and break down by myself, but this time was unfortunately not one of those times. This week in particular was hard for me, and I had a big event for a friend this weekend that I was a part of. Long story short, I had a little breakdown and ruined my friend’s event. I was exhausted and was experiencing too much sensory overload that I had a breakdown. The event still went on without me, as I left, but it is clear that I affected it negatively for her and for others. I would not be surprised if my friend were angry at me, but we have yet to sit down and talk about it. 

My friend knows I have a history of mental health issues, but she did not really know about this most recent episode because I didn’t tell her about it. She has a lot going on in her own life and I didn’t want to burden her. But it’s clear I inadvertently burdened her anyway. I am trying to do my best to pull myself together and process my feelings so I can sit down and explain everything from my side to her while acknowledging what I did hurt her and not use my depression as a scapegoat excuse. Also contacted more therapists in hopes someone is accepting new clients.

"[27 M] not sure if this is the appropriate place to post but I feel like outside perspectives could help. Since early adolescence I’ve always struggled with a strong feeling of worthlessness and for the most part I’ve been able to mask it. I’ve made plenty of friends who love me dearly and have an amazing support system but nothing feels right. I typically will be feeling “okay” for months on end and then get into a really bad slump after where I frequently contemplate just ending it. I’ve been trying to get out of that mindset when it arises but it’s becoming so hard as of late. I’m unhappy with my current job (a combination of not getting paid well and just having 0 interest in anything), unhappy with my home life (some abuse from parents), and lately unhappy with relationships (girlfriend of nearly 5 years left and found someone else [which frankly I don’t even blame her]). I want to fix my life and my mindset but I just don’t know how to find the motivation to do so. I’ve talked to friends about how I’ve been feeling and it’s basically always find some hobbies, focus on bettering yourself, etc. whenever I do try to take life by the horns I can keep it going for a few days at best before I find myself staring at my ceiling hating myself again. The worst part about having friends willing to talk to me and support me is that I end up feeling even more worthless and selfish. There are plenty of people who have it much harder than me and I feel worse that I just can’t accept the blessings I do have in life and just be happy.

"For context, I am a mid twenties male living with several roommates who are my closest friends. I am posting on an anonymous account because people I know in really life know my main account. 

I did not think that I had depression, but recently I have been stuck in a loop of reliving moments and beating myself up for what I said or did. I feel extremely intense guilt and shame over things that I know should not bother me to the extent that they do. To give an example, I said something mean to one of my close friends months ago. I was trying to make people laugh, but I was drunk and clearly wasn’t funny. Whenever I do something like that, it ruins the next week of my life, but it never used to. This inability to forgive myself came out of nowhere about 4 months ago. The guilt is crushing. It feels like every day I do something else and that becomes a new thing to feel guilt over. Again, it isn’t big things, it’s accidentally being rude, offending someone, not paying attention when someone was talking to me, anything. I relive these mistakes over and over, beating myself u.

Yesterday, I was drinking with my friends. I do not think that I did anything to embarrass myself, but today I feel overwhelming anxiety, stress, and depression. I cannot bring myself to face any of them. I don’t understand why I feel like this. In my head, they are all judging me and do not like me anymore. Having to look them in the eye feels like it would kill me, so I spend days hiding from everyone in my room when I wake up feeling like this.

If anyone has advice on what I can do to stop feeling this way, I could really use it. It’s causing me to stop liking who I am.",1
"I’m 21. I’ve felt this crippling loneliness for as long as I can remember. I feel I can’t really connect with anyone and any friends I make, I end up not being able to stand them, I don’t want their qualities to rub off on me so isolate myself, and I’ve felt this crippling loneliness all my life. My past friends have had a lot of good qualities too but my mind focuses on what I don’t like and I can’t stop thinking about it. It drives me crazy. I find myself not wanting to work on my friendships either because I feel like there is no spark or I don’t like them enough to work on it. I don’t want to talk to anyone in my life. I feel like I don’t belong anywhere. I feel like an alien who doesn’t understand how friendship or social interaction works.Am I expecting perfection from people or have I not yet found my community or am I an alien?",1

"I have been in a deep depression all my life. At the age 39 I am confronted to the idea that I would never be happy or ""normal"". I pretty much tried all treatment but nothing worked.
Have any one of you tried the ketamine protocol when it comes to depression. I know it is fairly new but I keep reading that the people who are part of the study find their life improving drastically. Is it your case ?
Take care of yourself.",1
"Lemme just say high school is not that bad I should’ve enjoyed it more. I had a big group of friends my dear sweet Caroline, but now covid happened and I never saw them again. My friends are out of my life moving on to other things, Caroline left the state and I have lost contact with her. I wanted to take her somewhere special at night then propose to her and ask her to start a family with me, but no. I also got rejected from serving in the armed forces and I’m now stuck being a grocery bagger having to listen to walking talking birth control ads scream like fucking morons while dealing with their middle aged schlub parents who just want to make everyone else as miserable as they are. I want to flat out tell the customers and my boss “GO FUCK YOURSELF AND GO TO HELL!!!” but I need this job to pay my share of rent and bills so I can’t afford to be fired better keep my mouth shut I suppose. I also have to mention I have autism and I’m very high functioning, but my parents are overbearing. They think I’m some retard who needs to be watched 24/7. I’m high functioning I’m not fucking Timmy from south park. They treat me like a child all the time. I love them very much, but sometimes I wanna tell them “screw off I’m not a kid anymore and you’re not my keeper” but since I’m an adult they can legally kick me out and I can easily end up on the streets alone and talking to myself just like that. I’m also failing college I wanted to be a software engineer, but it is impossible especially with my fucking boss breathing down my neck making me work longer hours so there is that another fail from me. I just want to be happy again like the good old days. I’m a fucking loser! A friendless, single, military rejectee, grocery bagging, failed college student, parents house fucking clown! I am in hell. What did I do to deserve this? What can I do? Any advice would be appreciated.",1
"Years ago I just wanted to runaway from home. Go anywhere far from here. I wasn't able to, and now I feel like I'm in a cage. My mom guilt tripped me so much, I don't feel comfortable with the idea of going away anymore, but it's so terrible to be at home that I just feel like I have nowhere. My mom always says that I can trust no one but her, and she's so manipulative, I'm so tired. Every day I wish I was never born. I go through all of this and I don't feel like I have anyone to talk to and be truly honest. My grandpa died last Sunday and I didn't even tell anyone close to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be 22 next month and I have no hope for my future. I'm in law school, and even though I do pretty good when it comes to grades, I just feel like I'm incompetent and that nothing is gonna change. I'm not gonna find a job, nor will I build a life for myself, buy a car, a house, anything, it's as if life was over before it even started. I feel anxious all the time, I never feel really happy, it's just so crushing. And it's not like I have no basis to feel this way, my country is ruined, the pandemics did not help, it's a never ending mess. It's not just in my head. I don't know. I wish I could be happy at some point, that's all.",1
"I’m not sure if I’m depressed but I don’t feel right. I don’t care about anything or anyone. If people tell me someone close to them has died I don’t care. I think about if my equivalent died and I don’t care. I just feel so unfeeling bad I hate that about myself but only because I feel like I should feel bad about it. Im not passionate about anything but I’m also not suicidal because I like my life enough that I don’t want to die, plus I’m an atheist so I don’t believe anything happens after you die. I have a partner of six years, I have a best friend and I love them but they’re so passionate about so many things and I feel so empty. The only things I care about are my three cats and two dogs because they’re completely dependant upon me and they’re my babies if it wasn’t for me they would die. But it’s sad because is it like I need people to be dependant on me to feel anything? I feel like a monster sometimes and I don’t like it but also I don’t care enough to do enough to change anything about it. I just feel so empty and I don’t care about jack shit…",1

"Im tired doing all of this every day. The worst thing about it is that you have to smile, be functional and do your everyday stuff like you are okay. Noone will notice the struggles and emptiness inside you. I keep thinking about the shtty things i did in the past and just can't get over them. Feeling cursed because when something good is happening i always screw up, thats my pattern. I have nobody and nothing, only the bad memories that remain. Hunt me in my dreams, where people usually rest or at least escape from reality. When the guilt eats me so i have to feed it with cigarettes or cuts.(funfact:blood doesn't come out easilly from textiles) I drink alcohol no more, it just makes me vulnerable and embarrassed. On the other side, i train a lot to make myself tired, but its just not enough. I seriously want to end the whole thing but im terrified about a few things:
1) saw a few suicide pics, i don't want to look horribly when they find me
2) my tattoo artist did a lot of work and i would feel sorry for her
3) My act would traumatize my litle brother

"I feel like it’s been happening for a while now, where I’ve just wanted to give up. It started on small things, like hobbies that failed to keep me interested. When i broke up with my X because i saw no future. When work got too much, I changed career paths and still fell into the same hole. And now the last things keeping me going feel like they’re fading away. The thoughts of self harm have only gotten stronger. My life, in my eyes, is worthless. The solutions uncovered in therapy haven’t worked to curb anything. Medication feels like it only makes things worse. It sometimes feels like it’s time to give up, and I’m sick of feeling this way but there is zero part of me that has the energy or will to dig myself out of this. There’s no one to fight for. There’s no one to fight for me. I’m just ready for this to be over, i don’t know what to do anymore, and I’m scared of what options I have left for myself in my head.",1

"I probably started seriously considering suicide in my early teens, but I always thought I could never go through with it because of how much my mother loves me and knowing she wouldn't cope, i know everyone else would be ok probably. 

Lately (and I feel like a piece of shit for saying it) at 27 years old I don't really care anymore, I want to die more than I care about hurting anyone.

I know my ex will take great care of my dog since we got her when we were still together and she lives on a farm where she will probably be happier anyway.

So I don't have any real reason to stay alive other than my Mom but she's tried to kill herself twice when I was a child and didn't care about what it would do to me so I think it's only fair that I'm allowed to aswell.",1

"I’m a 14yr M with 4 verbally abusive sisters and parents with crippling expectations. My sisters make sure I know how worthless I am. How I listen to “bad” music, that I’m ugly, I have bad fashion, I’m weak, soft, lanky, dork, nerd, insane, stupid, “weird”, how I victimize myself, addicted to games, and I’m “selfish”. My parents say I can be whatever I want to be then remind me how I haven’t fulfilled there expectations I am severely dyslexic and I have only known that for the past year but my whole life I was below average in school because of that my parents wouldn’t take my 100% at the end of the year of trying and stressing just trying to make them happy all I get is “you need to work hard” so what was even the point. At the age of 10yr I got depressed and what came with that was just everyone I loved mocking me so I learned to hide my feelings I found out even asking for a apologize was pointless because they would get defensive and then everyone would get hurt I love my sisters and I would die for them without question but they only take advantage of that and even say I’m selfish even when I have died to myself. I only live for them and my friends/family so words like that kill me even more. I can't explain the pain of living for someone for them to treat you like trash then say “you're victimizing” yourself when I’m depressed. Now I don’t care if I believe the lies because it’s easier to listen to the 6 voices that I love telling me how I will never be anything compared to my voice that says they are lying but then what? Do I hate them back that would make me a hypocrite and take the reason I have to live. If I will never be enough, what's the point? Tbh I agree with them and now I hate myself so I punish myself and self harm is the only thing that improves my mental health for a time. I know if this continues I’m going to kms and I have already wanted too twice so why not.",1

i just want to sleep all the time and although i'm generally quite the couch potato, this is more than what's normal for me. my ocd has gotten a bit worse and sometimes i feel like crying (like right now) when i being to think about how i'm feeling. what's funny is that i don't even fucking know how i'm feeling.

"You wake up in a stupor. Bone dry. Lackluster everything. Depressed as fuck. You pray to God that it’s just a little morning blues that’ll wear off, but you know the truth: you’ve been feeling this way all day every day for months, if not years. No amount of caffeine, exercise, binge eating, illegal drugs, romance, anything really, can lift it. It’s your new normal. Yea yea, every few weeks you have an “up” day, but it’s so infrequent it feels more like a cruel reminder of how everyone else feels living out their life. You question reality, maybe nobody is happy. You consider death many times, knowing it is desirable and undesirable. You chose life, but it doesn’t feel like life even when you have money in the bank, a car to get you around, family support, rare amenities, running water, chocolate and milk at any time you’d like to indulge. But each and every blessing mocks your reality, which is one of apathy and anhedonia (lack of feeling). Time feels like a poison slowly tightening it’s grip on your insides. I don’t know whether to sit idly, or do something, and find out what I’m already beginning to understand: that death is imminent, that my striving is futile, that love ultimate hurts you, that God chooses to hide like a child. You are alone, no one is coming to save you. Whether you sink or swim, they lead to the same result: you, as light as the grass blowing in the wind, swallowed by destiny, or by some other beast of the field.

"The night before yesterday I had some type of bizarre episode. I don't know if it was a panic attack due to my anxiety disorder or what but all i know is that I could not move my body for a minute. I was wide awake too. I was feeling intense fear surging through my body and was feeling terrified to die. For the past 2 weeks I've been having suicidal thoughts because I just cannot handle life and the misery that comes with it to say the least. And that night was the first time in a month where my fear of dying trumped my suicidal thoughts. Anyways, I felt pain in my chest and my tinnitus that i developed 2 weeks ago got incredibly loud. I began feeling fear of everything and life itself. Fear of other people, fear of the idea of trying to make friends, fear of even the concept of one day dating someone and being intimate. I could not fathom how i even got my stupid part time job, go to school, or even hug my own dad. I then felt fear of being in my own body and then I couldn't move. Just lay there in my bed and blink. could not even open my mouth. I kept telling myself to move my arm but couldn't. A minuet passed and then finally i could move again for some reason. I eventually fell asleep.

The next day (yesterday) when i was in the shower it happened again. Couldn't move. My mind was not working together with my brain. or maybe it's my nerves? Yesterday i was not able to get any school work done either and i'm falling behind. (I'm in college btw just getting an AA in pretty much nothing now since my major won't work.) Then that night i went to church. I hadn't gone in two years. I planned to go because I wanted to pray and ask God to kill me. I ended up not doing that after the night before. But the priests homily was about how we're all going to die. Made me feel more depressed honestly. 

Today I've done nothing except lay in bed. I'm extremely exhausted. I'm on a drug called Gabapentin and it makes my short term memory all fucked up. It's hard to even focus on typing this right now. I've forgotten alot of things and things i need to get done and it makes my life harder. I literally keep forgetting in this moment what i want to say so i keep re-reading this post. 

I'm quite anxious now about my well being because things just keep getting worse. I don't know if i should go to the hospital after writing this out or what because I feel like my brain and mind are fighting each other and my thoughts are not makingg a lot of sense to me. I'm having trouble finding more words to explain what is going on because there was a point to this when i first began typing.",1

I don’t want to die but I don’t think things are ever gonna get better for me. everything is dull and continues to be the same, i’ve been lonely for years and nothing has been able to change. maybe i’m just meant to feel like this, maybe I deserve to be alone forever.

I am always treated like trash. I give my all, but still everybody blames me for everything and trash talk about me. I eat lunch alone, at coffee breaks I am alone. Because everybody ignores me. I know all this looks childish, but I am not sure how much can I go on. Atm I am writing this with tears in my eyes and for some reason I am not afraid to admit it.

"For the past year and a half, I'd been on unemployment benefits while searching for a job. I'd landed a few freelance gigs here and there which paid well but weren't sustainable or long-term. I foolishly turned down a pretty decent job in March because at the time I was making way more with freelance jobs. I've reached out to them recently asking if they're still hiring but they didn't call me back. This summer, I was head over heels for someone that really reciprocated my feelings. I'd been casually dating since my last long-term relationship ended when I was cheated on. I really thought I found someone for the long-haul but after a month and a half of us both saying ""I love you"" she decided she wanted polyamory, which flared up my anxiety so bad that I was throwing up daily. I ended it, but had another hook-up with her a month later, just for my healing to reset. This past weekend, I hooked up with a close friend of mine, who I've liked for a long time, but was sure nothing would ever happen. After we hooked up she very firmly told me she didn't want anything more than casual and doesn't think we should hook up again. I still live with my parents and I'm pushing 30. I still pay rent and am responsible. I used my unemployment money to pay off my car, but now my funds are running out and by the end of the month, I'm pretty much fucked if I don't get a job. I'm just feeling like a failure both career wise and dating wise. I feel unwanted by everyone and it fucking sucks. I'm tired of it and I feel hopeless.",1

"Im pathetic… man at this points it's a wonder i'm still alive. Someone like me needs to die. I mean honestly, You can't even dream within the realm of reality. You are literally going to be an adult soon and you have nothing to show for it. Sometimes I wonder who you are, this voice that constantly shows me everything wrong with me as you hang on my heart making it so heavy I can't even breathe. I guess at this point you have gotten what you want somehow you fully convinced me that there is no point in my existence. I mean it's not that I think you are wrong, I'm entirely worthless at this point, I will probably die soon but I guess a pest has it coming right? I think I want to die while I still have this shred of dignity, before my life becomes somehow more embarrassing or more of a burden then it already has been. Honestly I would have done it a while ago. I probably just want to wait a while since my dad's dad and his brother so I should wait a while. I guess its been long enough at this point so I don't know what i'm waiting for I should just die already I literally am so disgusting i just eat and shit and waste so much I don't know how I can be so deluded and think I deserve to be happy when all I do is leach but honestly I just don't care enough anymore I would rather just sleep but since I don't wanna leach any more Im just gonna kill my self it seems like the natural progression to me right? Honestly a part of me wishes I wasn't so useless. I mean life doesnt honestly seem so bad to one half of me but the half tells me that if im never gonna grow up I need to die before people think im more retarded than they already think I am. I mean dont get me wrong I know im dumb, Ive lived as a shut in since middle school and have failed every imaginable way from every class to every expectation at this point I am just sub human garbage. I wish someone else could have been given my opportunities everyday, my parents and siblings are such amazing people the fact that I can imagine them somehow being sad when I die says enough by itself which maybe is why I just fall into tears whenever I try to kill myslef or maybe I'm just a dumbass who doesn't even get to compare my problems to some truly amazing people who are going through incredibly hard times, probably the ladder. Honestly Im so dumb I should just die I mean I can somehow think of things like getting a girlfriend and shit like that, as if any girl would go out with a fucking retard fatass, I hope I can kill myself brfore I grow up and learn to work so I can stop being such a pest. Why is it that when I think of something to lift the weight on my chest the first and only thing I can immagine is laying is someones lap telling me its ok and that im fine as I am is that why Im writing this god im so dumb. My life is a mess I was homeschooled at a young age because my best friend was being molested and wanted me to suck his cock and my teachers werent teaching me shit, so my mom fuckin said fuck that and tried to teach me herself whish is pretty hard when your son is dyslexic i guess so she kind of just gave up so I guess ive been alone for a while busy parents siblings 15 years older than you no education no friends, and here I am 17 just thrown into highschool failing every class skipping class to sit in the snow alone. Now dont get me wrong my parents and siblings are so amazing so none of this is there fault in the slightest, I just want someone to understand me for once but it's too late at this point since im probably already dead when people are reading this I just wanted someone to hear what was going on through my mind in final moments as proof i existed or something.

Rn I'm in a hostel for studying. Everyone in the hostel including my roomate seems to be pretty close to each other and it's just me whose left out like I just don't even talk with anyone irl. I tried but couldnt find any common grounds. I just gave up. I haven't talked to a person more than a min for prolly over a month rn. Whenever my parents call me I just say it's pretty much great but deep down I just wanna kms. It's not the ""with our friends part"",its the only one without friends part that's hurting me. Anyways rn I'm studying really hard to acheive what I always wanted to be,a doctor. I hope i just turn out to be one like my younger self wanted to be. I cant find consistency cuz of this fuckind depression. I always thought my 19 would be so great but here I am crying all day without friends and fuckin lonely.",1
"That moment when you finally realise that you are being purposely ignored by a bunch of useless people who don't themselves have any value of their own they seek pleasure by doing this .
Situation even gets worse when other people viz the whole world is on the same boat and you are on the other side alone , miserable lying all weak.
I have been forced to live a lonely life , loneliness deludes mind loneliness drives people crazy loneliness is like a mental prison. I am not surprised that most of the people here are having suicidal thoughts it's completely fine to have this if your situation is same as described above. Suicidal thoughts are now a normal thing for me and it's common for me to have them now thanks cruel world, thanks even if people like us die this cruel world will be more happy than before and indifferent to us",1
"I’ve been struggling with depression my whole life. I’m in college right now 22 years old and it’s only gotten worse. The only reason I stop myself from
committing is because it would hurt my family and I don’t wanna do that to them. I’m only hanging on by a thin string for them. I had high expectations for myself and I thought my life would be so different. But as of now, I literally have no friends, no one to talk to or hang out with. My old friends cut ties with me and some are busy with their boyfriends. I know comparison is a thief of joy but it’s hard not to be depressed when it seems like everyone is living their best lives. I deleted all my social media so I can live in my own bubble and isolate myself even more. I wish I could just sleep all day and not have to do anything. I don’t want to be perceived anymore I don’t wanna be alive.I hate it when people are like things will get better. No they don’t. I’ve been living in this viscous cycle for a while now. Maybe things will change when I leave college I’m not sure. I’m depressed for a plethora of reasons I hate the way I look and I hate my body no matter how much I exercise I’m still considered “fat”. I attempted dating but every guy I ever talk to ghosts me or doesn’t seem interested it hurts my feelings and makes me feel as if I’m unwanted and ugly. My GPA is trash the one thing that I do have control under and it’s a mess and on top of that I’m graduating late and everyone will move on with their lives. My life is so boring and it’s the same day over and over again. I feel like society makes it seem like in your 20s you should be traveling living it up, engaged, have a job and I haven’t hit any of this check marks at all. I’m just lost and confused and I don’t know what I can do to make a change in my life if anything I just need advice. If this is how life is going to be I don’t wanna live anymore. TLDR: depressed with the way things are in my life what can I do to make a change. (Change body composition, make friends, increase gpa, make life exciting)",1

"First of all sorry for bad English and its my first time typing this much so bare with me.
\-In the past 4 years i had more then 10 friends and we all did what you think and 18/17 old teenagers would do, last year(2020-2021) was our final year before collage so we had to be careful because our country's education system is so bad that if you want to understand anything you must have privet classes (and they were expensive) so we had to either attend at a certain institution or he would come home, So as a group of friends we had home/institution classes together for about a year sharing the good and the bad and every thing sounded good until the results came.
\-I just want to say that i really really wanted computer science and i studied as hard as i can facing negativity, hatred, MY PARENTS, MY FAMILY, my country's bad educational system plus a lot of stress and even one surgery that made me sit for about a month, i got addicted to cafe, i had insomnia i would just sleep for about three hours and wake up for my classes not because i was late on assignments but also because i didn't feel like i did enough so its safe to say that my mental and physical health was so bad through out that year.
\-Our results came and no one talked to the other (as i thought because no called or asked me except two) i didn't get what i wanted and had to wait for about 4 months to see what collage would take a loser like me and i didn't or wasn't able to sign for a non-governmental institution because i didn't want to be self and make my father all that money on me.
\-Here is something important in this time i only had two best friends (at least that is what i think about our relationship) and four friends.I lost a lot of people in my life two of them were my best friend for about 4/5 years (again at least that is what i think about our relationship) and it was so easy for them the others just forgot that i even existed and even some of them were so so mean to me i hate every moment of them roasting me while my best-friends joined them and they knew they were hurting me i was in a toxic and abusive relation with them but i didn't feel like it i was deceived that i didn't notice it.
\-The only person that helped and he was my favorite person in the world stood by my side and told me to leave them than i did i also had a lot of issues dealing with toxic relations so he was the only person that i talked to him and he was a good listener i want to say that i helped him with his problems but i didn't have the skills or knowledge to help all i did was just listen and comfort him i will call him T.
\-In the last month i was still getting mentally abused by my family, only four ""friends"" (they are decent because one of them is a narcissist and stole something from me and was my very close friend and they said don't make a big out of it) and my government.T was the only person that comforted me and i really appreciate his existence but he has been acting really weird and sometimes i would talk to him and he wouldn't give me attention at all for example i told him that i saw a girl that i couldn't think straight because of her and i didn't want to take because i don't want to destroy my healing process and all what he said :
T: Talk to here.
Me: I cant. T:okay (and continues to play lol as if i didn't say any thing). so now i don't have any one to talk to and i think about ending it all but i cant because i am scared from death what should i do at this point i don't think that i will be normal any more.",1

"I feel sad for this girl in my class. I like her a lot. I'm not sure if she's depressed, but I'll list some things about her and her relationships with other people. **The highlighted words are the most important parts, just in case you don't have much time to read.** ***(The TL;DR is formatted like this)***
&amp;#x200B;
* **She's always been very nice**, but she also has **weak willpower**. She's also **shy**, **smart** and **empathetic**.
* We used to be very close friends **some years ago,** but **I treated her very badly. I was a very toxic friend.** She eventually got away from me. We haven't really interacted ever since.
* She's made new friends since we distanced, but **she's never been very integrated in whichever groups she's been in**. In fact, **most people don't care about her.**
* Her previous group of friends, which was quite big, recently dissolved into smaller groups, but she's not in any of them. **She barely has any friends now.**
* **She always stays in class during breaks**. If she has homework, she does it. If she doesn't, though, she stays there, **alone**, looking sadly through the window, which is honestly heartbreaking.
* **The person she spends the most time with is a boy** (because the boy also likes her), but I was told **she's sick of him** because he's very annoying, **but she is too nice to do anything about it, so she lets him be with her but tries to avoid him when possible.**
* **She usually appears to be sad.** It don't remember seeing her happy in a long time. In fact, she **rarely smiles or laughs.** She used to be much more cheerful.
* She's a good student, but her older sister was a perfect student who got 10s in everything. She probably believes that the bar's too high, especially since when we were friends she told me that **she has very strict parents who expect her to be like her sister. She probably has low self-esteem because of that.**
* Some weeks ago, we were told in school to write down compliments we'd love to recieve on the blackboard. She wrote things such as ""I believe in you!"", or ""You are doing great!"". **She just wants somebody to encourage her and to be proud of her... Possibly because nobody ever does that to her.**
* **She also wants to feel useful and strives a lot.** Last week we crafted and decorated cardboard stars to give to children with cancer. She was striving so hard, running around, giving material to everyone who needed it, painting a lot, throwing remains of cardboard in the trash... I'm confident she worked harder than everybody else, but nobody congratulated her, or said anything at all. That seems to be a recurring thing in her life, sadly.
* **People tend to forget about her.** Last year it was the last year of a school stage, so we did this scruffy ""graduation"", organized by some people of our class. They gave everybody a graduation bar with a funny nickname... except for her. They literally forgot about her. **She tried to hide it, but I could tell she was very sad because of this.**
* ***TL;DR - She probably feels like almost nobody cares about her... which is sadly kinda true. She spends a lot of time helping other people, and nobody ever does the same for her; she has low self-esteem, her ""friends"" forget about her, she's sick of the one person she's usually with, she's had toxic relationships, she always seems sad and she just wants to feel loved, useful and wants somebody to be proud of her...***
Remember how I said I used to be very toxic? Well, I like to think I'm not anymore, and it's all because of her. She's always been extremely nice, and when I lost her friendship I realised how good of a friend and person she really was, and tried to change, inspired by her. She's helped me become a better person more than even my parents! I still have my personal diary from when I was a bad person, and I'd never write something like that now, so I guess it worked! I owe so much to her! I am proud of her, I care about her, I find her useful and I love her! I want her to know this!
I'm not sure if she's depressed, but **I want to help her so bad**... But I just don't know how. **I'm afraid of approaching her because last year they told me that she still suffers because of what I did to her.** And I can't blame her, honestly. But it brings me so much pain to see her so lonely and in need of support... I just want to be there, for her, 24/7. I'd do anything for her. She honestly deserves it. **What can I do for her?** I want to approach her, let her know I'm genuinely there for her and make her as happy as possible. Should I discuss this with a teacher before, or approach her directly? **I don't want to do anything that could harm her.**
Thank you VERY VERY MUCH for reading. Please refer to me as Max and her as Nora. Those names are not real. Also, English is not my first language, so excuse me if something isn't clear. Feel free to ask.",1
"The biggest sign I know my depression has come around again is when I start thinking about a botched relationship from 10 years ago. It was short, we were in high school, but that's what triggered my depression and I didn't talk about how I felt for years and years. So while I know the actual event hasn't had any real impact on my or my ex's life, sometimes I feel stuck in that moment again and feel like my life will never be okay because of the choices I made back then. This is what I obsess over endlessly when I'm feeling depressed, even though I can't change anything and honestly my current life has a lot of good in it.

I'm curious what other things that are seemingly ""not so bad"" that everyone else obsesses over when they're depressed.",1
"Ok, I’m so fcking done rn. I’m not going to slave for some stupid organisation that has disgusting idiots living there. I’m not going to slave away for society bc I didn’t finish college. Fck that shit.",1
"Yelling at people is the only time I feel like I have control over something in my life. Just yelled at my mom over something incredibly stupid and now I'm crying in the bathtub , probably about to relapse I'm so fucking angry for no reason at all",1
"I just really need a rant.

I'm 23 and I'm about 10 years into my depression and anxiety. I've just been sat thinking about some of the shit I've experienced in those years and how I am now in comparison.

I remember days of not having a clue what was happening to me. My best friend and girlfriend had been killed at 13, I was coming home from school just feeling nothing. I'd lay on my bed, go on my phone and for every night it'd be hours of being lost in my phone. 

 My last girlfriend went through my darkest patches with me. It tore us up so bad but we always came out on top. I'd sit in my chair for 2 hours so down and depressed but not saying a word. I'd get irritated with her, shouting out that I'm in pain but couldn't give her an answer of what to do to help. 

Everything went downhill. showering, staying hydrated, eating, just about everything everything makes us functioning humans, I was not doing. I smoked weed from 15 and used that to help calm me down a lot. I'd have anxiety attacks, my breathing would stop, I'd be shaking sat on the floor in sheer panic. I lost my job in 2018 and lost my house as a result. My girlfriend then left me 2 days later and my mum didn't let me come home. They're alive but I'm without parents. My dad is a typical disappear dad and my mum never dealt with her depression so she's constantly in a state of denial and being a careless person towards me and refuses to admit the problem. 

After loosing my house I moved in with my mentor who had helped me through my teens and became a second dad. After 4 months with 3 of us in one small house, the tension rose and we were asked to find places to live. I was moved into a homeless hostel for 4 months over Christmas and had absolutely nobody. No friends in town, no family in contact, just me in the smallest box room without my xbox and TV. 4 fucking months. It was torture. This 4 months was still within the time that I felt broken and suicidal. I saw so many strangers in different associations trying to find me places to live, so much travel time with people I didn't know, all telling me the usual it'll get better keep your head up which at the time I of course didn't want to hear. 

I sat on the beach and pleaded over the phone to each of my parents to just give a shit about my existence as their child before I chose to leave this world for the next. They didn't help. They didn't think I was serious. I took them and my mum called a police car that took me to the hospital. I came out eventually to nobody, back to the homeless hostel with 24 hour staff for at risk people. 

I'd sit every night and wonder about death. I'd watch suicide survival videos in hopes to lift me up but it made me feel no better. I completely lost my way and became somebody else. 

I've had my current job since June and have worked 60 ish hours a week just to not be at home alone with my head. I'm in my own flat now as of last February. 

I'm still no better. But my overall feeling and outlook on the world has changed. I'm here because of my 12 and 13year old siblings and I'm gradually feeling like I'm here for myself. I'm able to be happy and enjoy things now with minimal struggles. 

I honestly think my key to this was spending this last year fully on my own. I learned a lot about myself, I had nobody to answer to, I could be me without having to stop for anybody. I believe there's a way out, although I'm still tortured by my past and my demons daily. I think it's possible. 

It starts with me",1
"I’m just so tired, just got rejected by a girl I’ve known for years, I have a shit load of family problems, I’m overweight and I have a pornography addiction. Ive tried to get help and many people at home and school told me to get help but nothing works. Overwhelmed by life and I personally feel that if I weren’t here everything would go away",1
That's all. Can't do it. Only thing I know is how much I love my family. They always assumed I am a smart guy but fucking hell it takes like one and a half brain for keeping up with this shit,1
"Im just tired of trying to get better, Nnothing i have tried ever worked and i have decided to just give up. Everyone left me and no one wants to talk to me either.
I dont want to feel better at this point i dont want help, i just want to die.",1
"I'm so ficking tired of things going wrong, I just want things to go right for me for once. I'm about a step and a half away from jumping off the fucking edge.",1
"Tomorrow is my 18th birthday. I was looking at insurance, because I'll need it at the end of the month. It'll cost €120 per month at the very least, and then there is also the excess (not completely sure since English isn't my first language) which is at least €385 per year. Most people don't come close to filling that €385, but because of depression it's already filled up for me. I can't work a lot because of depression as well, I only make €190 per month. That doesn't leave a lot to spend on what makes life a bit more bearable for me.
tl:dr Because of depression I make a lot less than most people, and I have to pay more.",1
"I don't know why I'm even writing this.

Lonier my whole life. It was fine, I just needed a girl. I guess my standards were too high cause I pass on just about all of them.

Got burned on my career/college degree job. Decided to work for myself in a different field. Never made any money. I just stayed with my parents in my room for 10 years.

But I gave up TV, video games, computer games, and just did good stuff for myself like reading, meditation, exercising, and going out to social events, but nothing ever came of it.

Nothing clicked but I never gave up. My horniness pushed me no matter how depressed I got (you read that right). All my master plans involved women in one way or another. But I kept not getting results so I stayed in my room more and more and went out less and less. ""Why bother?"" became the background music of my life when it came to leaving the house.

My testicles got injured and my testosterone is a fourth or even less than it was before (right after the injury I went from a thick 5 o'clock shadow every day to only needing to shave once every three days). Now I can't even rely on my horniness to push me to do things. It has been years since the injury and I don't think I'll ever recover to even half sex drive. But I don't want to get on testosterone replacement therapy as I read it messes you up even more.

Manual labor was meditative to me, but I keep getting injured because of my low T (testosterone protects your joints). And all the entry-level jobs I get want me to become manager, but I just want to be left alone and make some money. So I keep quitting the jobs I get.

But my life of not working is catching up to me. Health issues that I can't pay for. High insurance rates cause I haven't had insurance (car, health, dental, etc.) for so long. 

**Now I just sit in my room. I have no desire to even play video games or to go out.** I *do* enjoy just going out to get some fresh air or to drive around. One time I was attacked by girls. I was happy to be alive and said ""I'm going to start going out for sure!"" but I just went back to sitting at home the next day.

**It's like I have a lobotomy.** There is some kind of disconnect in my brain. I guess it's from 10 years of not socializing. 

Worst of all, I'm kind of content. While in my room I made material (books, Reddit posts, graphics, videos, etc.) about the stuff I was interested in (self-help, health, politics, government corruption, etc.). I've written about everything I care about. So I'm kind of done with that. So I do feel like I've given *some* contribution to society, and that keeps from me feeling guilty about not working.

**I just stay in my room all day doing nothing.** I don't even browse the Internet like I used to. I'll get on Reddit or YouTube to explore a few topics I'm interested in. Other than that I'm just in my bed. I tried therapy several times, but I was never happy with the therapists I found. (I guess I was picky with them like I was with my women.) And my motivation is gone to find a good one.

Actually, I think my only motivation is to pay my bills on time. Took a job for a week just to pay this month's bills. I think I'm going to sell my car as prices are high right now. (I don't think I can even find the motivation to do that.) Sucks as I like the freedom, but I don't ever drive it.

I thought buying a car would be the answer to all my problems. But, like I said, I never drive it. I don't go anywhere. The problem is obviously in my head.

Yes, I've talked to my parents about things, but they just deny it all. Even if other people are doing my wrong, they'll make excuses for them. It's like they're afraid of they admit that other people have ulterior motives, then they would have to come clean about when they lied to me about critical life choices, which they'll never do as their reputation as good parents is EVERYTHING to them, even more important than their own children.

My parents wronged me a lot...

I also had an abusive grandpa I was staying with and that I would complain to people about. But they were of no help (all I wanted to hear was ""That's horrible!"" or ""You shouldn't put up with that"" instead it was ""Well, what can you do about?"" or ""Where are you going to go, you ain't got no money?"" even though I said nothing about leaving). **But once I cut my grandpa out my life what he did never bothered me anymore. I think I know the answer is to cut my parents out my life, but I don't really have the resources to do that, nor the motivation anymore.** 

So I just stay in my room doing nothing...",1
"I get stressed over things I know are stupid, but my brain doesn't see it that way. Something slightly bad happens and my first thought is how I just want it all to end. I have friends that I know I can talk to but I can't and I don't want to be a burden. At this point I'm a burden to myself, idk what I can do to help myself because I don't even have a reason.",1
"Lost my friends
I’m the type of guy that would always have someone’s back if they have mine no matter what. I don’t know why but after the lockdowns all my friends went cold it seems nobody really wants to hang w me anymore. I guess there is one or two that I’m still ok with, but I haven’t seen them in a long time and don’t know when I will. I lost some friends I never thought I would and never had a lot in the first place. It’s been 2 years since high school and it makes me wonder if they only hung with me cause we happened to be at the same place and they jus needed to look like they knew people or used me. This was my decision to have a small friend group I don’t trust people these days after some messed up stuff that happened to me in the past. I’m not gonna lie it does hurt seeing my day one never wanna even talk to me or anything or hit me back ever, but if that’s his decision then fine. It’s just hard for me to keep going on in life I’ve lost 2 relatives over Covid and now my close friends. I don’t have anyone that really supports me and I just feel like this life is pointless",1
and now all I can think is how jealous I am that she had the courage to do it and I don't. that she's dead and at peace and I'm not. I wish I could do the same and die.,1
"you dont actually care, no one cares, anyone who says they care is lying, they don't know me, they don't give a shit about me. Including you, you're wanting to comment on this aren't you? Well it doesn't mean shit. It means nothing to me, as I know you don't care, you don't know me nor want to know me. Same goes for everyone I know, even family, I have no liking towards any of my family, i'm cold hearted and deserve nothing, I just want to be left alone until I die. Most likely going to OD on paracetamol as I believe it to be the most painless method of suicide i've found after my extensive research, I don't know the proper time to do it, i'm always depressed at night time and I know i'll be better in the morning but I don't care. I want it to end now. There's too much stress, nothing to live for, no one in my life. I care about nothing except...death.",1
"I’m so pissed off with my former supposed “friends” of 11 years. One of them came over to London from Berlin and they went out for dinner on the Saturday night. I full on slept the whole weekend and didn’t leave my flat, so didn’t make the dinner. I got one text from one them saying “hi love everything ok?” And that was it. Then I went back into work on Monday and queue Tuesday and I messaged about our holiday on the Thursday where I’d booked a hotel and car. My friend replied “couldn’t got a hold of you, so we’ve booked to stay somewhere else, can you cancel the other one?” I called, left voicemails, texted, and went round to their place to speak to them. I literally got the door slammed in my face. I asked “what’s up” and they blamed me for being out of touch at the weekend. I said, “we’ve been friends for 11 years, I have a chronic illness which you know about, that I’ve had for 16 years, I’ve seen therapists, psychiatrists, am on multiple meds, been to rehab, and one of the symptoms of that illness is isolating and being out of touch. I was so angry, so I said “I’m done”. I couldn’t believe how people can pretend they “understand mental illness” and then go “you’ve could’ve text, we heard nothing from you”. It’s like saying I should be in control of my symptoms of depression. Can anyone relate? There’s a part of me that’s in shock that this has happened and wants to reconcile, and another part, that says, there’s absolutely no going back there. I just feel like the goal posts re their expectations were moved on without any conversation. They didn’t tell me, and once they did, they refused to talk to me. It feels awful that my best friends of 11 years could just throw me away like this.",1
"It isn’t the first time that I feel so bad. So, I’m here to ask if someone can help me to understand if i have depression or not. I know, depression is very serious, which is because, before I ask for help, I want to make sure I understand if I suffer from it or not.

P.S. sorry for bad english",1
"Not now nor next month and maybe not even next year, but one day I am going to finally put an end to my miserable existence. My birth was a coincidental error, I’m just don’t have the tools to make it work out. I’m just so sad and dysfunctional but everyone seems to think I got my shit together. I’m hanging by a thread and not a single soul knows it and even if I talked about it, no one would believe me.",1
"So some years ago I was in the fucking hate myself type of depression, it lasted for some years but the last couple of years I have left that state behind me thinking I was fine and good. However, got a setback couple of weeks ago and I'm now in the everything sucks type of phase. Realising this, I also realised that the years where I thought I was fine, well I wasn't. When I think about it in retrospect I have come to the conclusion that my body and head (unconsciously) accepted the depression as a part of my life. When I think of it, I can count on my fingers how many times I have been genuinely happy for the last 6 years or so. Colors just don't seem as bright as the once were. Not sure if I remember a time where I was genuinely happy and content with life. Thats freaking scary. Just wanted to know if someone else has that type of revelation where you realise that the depression never went away, but just became a part of your life.",1
"So years ago I came for advice to my mother about my depression.

I was crying and just not in a good mood.

She then proceeded to burst out laughing and taunt me and got my older sister to jeer at me as well.

At that point I was passively suicidal and then I became actively suicudal last year. So I went to my mother to talk about it. She was mad.

The thing she was mad about the most is that I was depressed for no reason. She said things like ""a therapist can't help you then!""

She also tried blaming my mental health on the pandemic even though I repeatedly made it clear that that was not the case.

She also had an aversion to calling myself depressed as if it was some dirty word.

She finally contacted her therapist friend from church for help. She was the absolute worst. I used the excuse of school starting back up an not having enough time to cancel the sessions.

When I told my mum that I was still depressed and suicidal, she was annoyed. She said that she couldn't fix an insolent child like me and that was the end of the conversation.

She did minor things like the classic ""nature is the best antidepressant"" but we mostly didn't talk about it.

I was under the impression throught the years that she was ignorant about mental health because she had never suffered from depression or suicidal thoughts in her life.

I discovered recently that this was not the case.

I found out that my mother realised that she was depressed in her early 20s (she's 58 now) and had also suffered (potentially still suffering) from suicidal thoughts.

Why was she depressed and suicidal? No reason.

This was over a decade before she met my shitty father and had two ""shitty"" kids with him.

Nothing went wrong with her life, she was just sad.

So why is she acting like this?",1
"I turned 19 two months ago. I'm a middle eastern white passing. I am in school in a 7 year BS/MD program. Many would like to be in my position, especially premeds. I live in the US. I'm 5'5.

I see famous 19 year olds. I got interested in Brazilian funk music. Mostly b/c the women in Brazil are wildly the most sexy women in the world. The US simply doesn't compare. Unless we're talking about the daughters of Brazilian immigrants.

I see people like MC Pedrinho. Look at his instagram. He's 19. He has girls literally masturbating in front of him at his shows. Not just any girls. Like ridiculously tall, fit, tanned, young, goddess faced girls. And he treats them like little mice. Like he's the main character. B/c he knows he can pick any of them and and fuck them immediately. Even if they have a boyfriend. He gets to wild out shirtless in front of them.

He's also a multimillionaire. Famous since 12 for making extremely sexual funk music. And don't hit me with the ""he will lose all his money with his liefestyle."" No. As the career elevates. More money will be made exponentially. Everyone has heard those stories, and nobody is going to try to repeat that BS.

Why should I live. Knowing I will be working my ass off indefinitely to be a doctor and stay a doctor. It is so enticing to wish I was a famous sex magnet. Who could wake up. Get a blowjob. Ejaculate in a beautiful girl's mouth. Eat sushi. Work out. Ride in my personal tour bus to a night club. Wild out. Repeat.

Cue ""stop comparing yourself"" ""social media."" Don't comment anything if that's what you have to tell me. I'm a realist. This is reality. This is my reality.",1
I’m done trying to prove myself to my highschool classmates. It’s been six years since we’ve graduated. I live four hours away. Why am I still seeking acceptance from these people?,1
Using this as an outlet but having something constantly blaring in my ears has helped me not think so much.,1
"What should I do if I am depressed and its kind of affecting my daily life? I am confused with am I just being lazy or I am actually depressed. I think I am falling back into my old patterns. Like if something really upsets me I can't work, I just don't do anything that day other than laying on my bed. I am also thinking of getting professional help but i am broke at the moment. I suffer from very low self esteem and I just wanna feel normal for once. Any advice will be appreciated.",1
"I live in Arizona. It's pretty nice here all year around. During the summer, I am fine. However, I've noticed around October or November, I start getting miserable depressed and hopeless. Arizona does have a change of seasons, but its not like it becomes dark and depressing out. 

I'm wondering if it could be SAD?

I did live in cold climates the majority of my life until the last five years. I'm maybe wondering if my mind is drawing off those experiences? For example, when it changes here a little bit, my mind subconsciously associates it with my experience in the colder climates? I was also wondering if maybe my mind was drawing off my childhood experiences? I lived in a toxic household and would often feel trapped and miserable during the winter. In the summer, I could go outside and play with friends, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks",1
"Trying hard not to text these people who have proven time and time again that they can’t be there for me when I’m low. Even though they say they want to be. It’s really hard for me to not lean on other people when I’m sad or scared about existing, especially because sometimes it’s okay? I just can’t tell when and am often left feeling even worse. So I’m trying to spend time doing other things so I don’t spend time calling or texting them but doing other things is like hard to do alone 🤦🏾‍♀️ so I’m just hiding under my blanket until further notice",1
i hate it here. i hate everything about it,1
"My life is falling apart and it truly feels like I’m at my breaking point right now. I’ve been having waves of panic attacks since Friday and I know that another one is coming soon. I’ve been crying, hitting myself, acting impulsively and putting myself in dangerous situations. I feel like it’s just going to get worse. I feel like I’m losing my sanity. The pain is unbearable. I’m in the UK and wondering if anyone here has ever been hospitalised before (voluntarily or involuntarily) and if so, what was your experience like? I’m particularly interested in the length of treatment, whether it’s made you feel any better, what you were allowed to keep, whether you had any communication with the outside world, etc.",1
"I miss the the time where I had friends to play Overwatch, Destiny, Minecraft, etc. with. I was still miserable and suicidal quite often but now I'm completely consumed by loneliness and apathy. Either I am suicidal or completely apathetic, there nothing in-between, lucky for me I guess, I havd found and gathered everything I need to kill myself quite effectively, I am just waiting for the final push now. No one cares, it doesn't make a difference if I am dead or alive.",1
"I have high functioning depression, I’ve never been diagnosed medically but it’s been two years that I am feeling really sad and depressed. I always feel lonely and that nobody would love me or care about me. I get the urge to cry every time if someone treat me nicely. I come back home and I cry for hours before sleeping. I feel like I am not worthy of being loved. I haven’t had a loving family in my childhood. My parents got divorced when I was 3 and I stayed with my mom. My mom doesn’t show her feelings so I never felt loved by anyone. Sometimes I think about killing my self but I don’t because I love my mom and I know she will be sad if I commit suicide. Now I am 19 I go to university, my grades are terrible, I can’t stay in one job due to my anxiety. I don’t see any light in my life, it’s just darkness.",1
"I don't want to keep going. I feel tired, betrayed, everything and everyone around me lied to me, hurt me, and now i have to keep going, but how? How can i still work on the things i need to do if i feel like i want to die everyday? The only person who keeps me alive and made me not straight up jump from my 9th floor is my mother, the only one who i still love. I don't even feel like living, i just feel like i have to keep going for the sake of it, because I'm obligated. So, how can i keep going? how can i still push it, if now that i felt i was finally getting out of this state i feel like i went back from where i started?",1
"Loving yourself can be hard, any suggestions?",1
"I just hate my life. Every night, at around 12-1 AM, I just sit in my bed crying and just hating life. I always think about regretting how I've built myself, my character if you would. If I would be put into a movie, you could say I'm a nerd, and I'm probably one of the people that pops up into someone's head when you think of the word, ""nerd"". I have built myself as a perfect, academic, and responsible girl to my family, friends, and whoever. I know my problem isn't comparable to others, but I can't help but feel jealous of my brother. I love him, but seems to be so so much happier. His character, is so funny, goofy, and overall really fun to hang-out with. Everyone likes him. It's like he gets along really well with anyone. He cracks jokes, that sometimes are uncalled for, but y'know, it's him, he can get away with it, but I can't. He and my former closest-cousin, (they live with us) are super close. They have similar interests, like games, music, art, sports, and both are very talented. And not to brag, but I am slightly better than my brother at acads. And it's really the only thing that's going for me. The only thing I can make my parents feel proud. So, I built my character around it. And recently, it's not going well. When the pandemic started, I switched schools, but that was really the plan after graduation. You see, I got in to a Science high school, which means it's harder, also, free. 7th grade, my grades were the same, and all is fine, some works were late, because I have never missed a due in my life b4. But now, my grades are really slipping. I know it's mostly my fault, since I do it at like 3AM, but still. My grades are the only thing that's holding me up. It's one of the things my friends and family know me for, and my brother's just on my tail. My grandma always says, ""always eat, you study wayyy too much"" which really makes me guilty, because I don't even study that much. So yeah, my grades have been slipping, and it might seem like such a ""smart kid problem"" to most people, and it is, but the passing grade for my school is 83-84, and before, it wasn't such a scare, since I got line of 9s every time. But now, I'm afraid it's going to hit that. And I'm bawling my eyes out because I'm too scared to disappoint my family. This is only one of my problems, but it's getting way too long and all over the place. 

TLDR: I think I have depression, but idk. I hate how I built my character because it's based on my academic success, and I am jealous of my brother being free, and super happy, and now that my only pride is going to be ruined, I am afraid my parents will be very disappointed.",1
I can't stop crying. I'm so lonely. It won't go away. It doesn't matter what I do. It never ends. My head hurts so bad now. I can't stop. I just need somebody to hold me. I don't want to be alone anymore. I don't want to remember anything anymore. I don't want to be alive anymore,1
"You can read about my lifetime battle with depression here:

"ik that it's probably just them living their lives but it always feels like when i'm at my lowest everyone shuts off and leaves me alone. it's like they dont want to or dont know how to be when im depressed and then it just feels like i dont have anyone becuase theyre only there when im joking and happy.

people say they are there for me to talk to them about anything but i know that's not true. My family prove it just abt everytime they talk to me, and i dont want to be the straw that kills one of my friends cus two thirds of them are severely depressed. they want me to vent to them but everytime they look worse for ware. and my problems just become another grain of sand in a desert.

it feels like i have a million problems and no one to talk to. im signed up for therapy but god knows how long that'll take.

i'm just another depressed queer kid looking for help and trying to cling on but i dont think i can last another couple years. i desperately want to move out but it seems like theres no escape because everything is so expensive. i cant make any plans because i cant see a future. i havent felt properly happy in years and by now it feels like i never will.

i cant enjoy any of my hobbies even though only a couple weeks ago i could. there's always small breaks of just being ""fine"" and then everything tanks for a year. 

nothing feels real anymore and questioning my gender does not help that. everyone feels like an enemy, not that it matters anymore. 

i just needed to vent a bit. thanks for reading if you did",1

"Eventhough i recognize that i don't have the biggest problems in my life i need to say this... i'm completely lost lately... Since i was a kid i have been marginated by the people of my age just because i was fat and someway smarter (yep that´s was me the little jeremy in every classroom...), but when i dropped off from school and i started the university my situation grew harder.. my elder brother was killed in a car accident and even after all this years we never got justice for his loss ( i even thought for while to make justice for my own) but a friend saved me from wasting my life. This girl was my best friend for almost five years and jokes on me... i fell for her, she was the only one who sincerely cared about me whithout any second intentions ( my other so called friends were more like parasites).. but as you can guess she never loved me the way i did. I tried to sustain her presence in my life with all my strenght but 2 years after my brother died (we split due to university) she did fall in love... but with somebody else. One night she told me we should not be judgmental with other people ( like get a girldfriend and do not complain) but she forgot that people does exactly that with me, anyway that was the last time i saw her... i did run away that night from her house..

In 2021 i recovered a little my entusiasm and i improved my grades at university ( i was doing awful after being considered a genius at school) but when everything was doing great life decided to knock me out again... i saved money for a car and i bought a second handed one, at first it looked great but 2 weeks after it started to fail again and again and again.. i´m responsable for this... i know... but my parents decided to help me but this piece of shit is wicked it seems... in the end i know that they are dissapointed as i am but also i know they are dissapointed of me... the kid they put all they hopes and dreams on, the man with the brilliant future but that´s it... future... a promise and i can no longer live on a hypothesis anymore, im dying for a little succes after all this years withdstanding this shit.

i have worked harder than the most of my colleagues but as long as i don´t have mountains of money or an important last name it seems that success is restricted to me... 

you may be thinking at this point what does this have to do with the title... well i have found some peace by singing grunge, some people say that im good but i tend to destroy myself finding mistakes... perhaps i will end like most grunge singers... either being a broken hero or taking a train that will lead me far far away.. iykwim.

sorry for the testament and thx for reading it.",1
"I’ve been with my partner 5 years, we are engaged and in the process of buying a house together! But deep down I am suffering &amp; nobody knows but me! 

I broke up with my long term ex prior to this relationship and I still haven’t fully got over it! I have just seen that my ex has just had her second child with her new BF (the guy she was cheating on me with) 

Is it weird I am like this still, a women who caused me so much pain and distress for so long and now I’m feeling like this? 

I sometimes get down and my partner doesn’t know why cause I hide it all we’ll try to and I feel like I can cause a rift in this relationship now! She’s a great fiancée and doesn’t deserve the mood swings when I see something about my ex! 

What is wrong with me",1
I’m sitting here in a bed that is not my own wanting to just take all the pills on the counter and just fall asleep I hate myself I turn everything I love to rot.,1
"in full honesty, the only times I have ever felt pretty was when I was raped and assaulted. because like, they thought I was so pretty, that they couldn't resist themselves. but yet, now, because of them, I over sexualize myself for attention and male validation. Because of them I cant stand being around men alone. because of them I have constant flashbacks of me being raped and assaulted. but something in me wants it to keep happening, so I feel valid, so I have a reason to feel something or cry. a reason to be sad? I don't know.",1
I can’t do anything right. I feel like I’m drowning and I just want to end it.,1
"I often hear about how people on post their positives, but I can't help but think that I haven't got any positives. My life is empty and I don't know where to start. I don't feel that anything I do will be worthwhile because someone else has already experienced better at a younger age.

I feel very silly about myself and incapable. I am discouraged and I feel very inferior. I'm not moving forward in life, I'm just treading water and losing my strength to keep my head above water.

I see the lives of others and I think to myself, I wish I were good enough to have a life like that. I'm disappointed and ashamed of myself. I have felt like this since I was sentient enough to compare myself to others, and it has beaten me down for the past 15 years.",1
I'll hopefully do it in a couple of days,1
"My life hasn’t been great for the past like 5 years and up until like half a year ago stuff was really stressing me out. The thing is, a lot of the problems I’ve had that were causing me huge amounts of stress, I have now resolved, but I don’t feel any better. I’m still in the same sad, depressed place, just as before. 

It just feels like nothing I do matters. That I won’t ever feel happiness again. Yes, there are days in which I’m alright, I am happy, but a day or two isn’t something. I have changed my life a lot for the better and yet, still empty inside and feeling sadness throughout the whole day. 

I haven’t talked to anyone about how I really feel and I don’t think I will. I wouldn’t want to bother the people close to me with my bullshit. I just wanted to vent a bit here, despite knowing no one cares. I guess it just helps getting it out.",1
"I recently turned twenty and was diagnosed with depression. I am in community college and trying to transfer to a university. I could’ve transferred to a four year school this past summer but my parents wouldn’t let me because I didn’t want to transfer to schools of their choosing. I have no friends where I am at currently, and have gone days without talking to other people. I have terrible social anxiety and can’t really find a way to cure it. I was in a relationship over the summer which ended the beginning of October, where I feel my depression started getting worse. This was the greatest relationship of my life and due to distance it didn’t work out. We barely talk anymore and while I would like to reconnect, it’s hard for me at this point. I feel useless and want this to end.",1
"The past week I have been getting worse and worse each day. I’m struggling to concentrate on doing anything, I can only keep a conversation going with my boyfriend for max 10 minutes, I can’t see a future, I feel like my body is made out of stone. I’m feeling numb, I can’t cry or express anything. I work in mental health so I’ve been off work the past few days, which is making me feel so guilty.
Does anyone have any advice, or literally any words to help right now?",1
Been feeling numb and detached the whole day. I dont enjoy the company of my friends. They are not the people I imagined to be friends with. I brought this all onto myself and i'm the sole reason why Im stuck in this college which I despise so much now. I would like to talk to someone about something. I feel so done. Been contemplating my suicide for the past few days.,1
"I would be floating around kinda functioning and even having happy moments here and there but then I feel very sad caused by something/someone and I then tend to cry a lot and then I would get sad about other things in my life and cry even more and after a while I'm just a mess crying about a different aspect of my life and not even the original thing and this screws me up for a few days. I try my best to avoid the original triggers but I can't help it when it's outside my control.
This is not every time I cry btw, I tear up occasionally about my life but it's temporary and I move on but these occasional times really fuck me up.",1
Boring plot that never goes anywhere. A bunch of filler scenes that don't change anything. Shallow and unlikeable side characters. Petty and pathetic main character that doesn't go through any meaningful arcs. Too much unresolved drama. Also goes on for way too long.,1

My mum is away more often now leaving me on my own and I think the loneliness is finally getting to me. All my friends and family are busy, I wouldnt want to inconvenience them anyway. I just keep thinking how I am not really needed in any way. My existence isn't all that needed for anyone. Everything can still function fine without me. I think the only reason I'm still alive here right now is that my cats need feeding. That's all that's keeping me living this laughably stupid existence.
I'm sorry if this doesn't fit, I just needed to rant to someone. Anyone.",1
"I am currently in the midst of my international exams...and they have been pretty trashy so far. Needless to say, I've spiralled back into my hell hole of excecutive dysfunction and self-hate. On top of my depression and suicidal thoughts, I've been having panic attacks daily and my ADHD is not helping me either (yes I'm diagnosed). So, for the first time in 6 years, I sought help from my friends. Previously, I would just try to deal with my problems myself because of my past experiences with friends and family when I was a lil child. My friends have been scolding me to get me to talk to them and open up more these few years...and I tried. I tried yesterday. When I couldnt get myself out of bed. I just sat on the bed and stared at my phone, wishing for a response, a word of encouragement...anything...but nope. As usual, they succeeded in disappointing me. I honestly dont know why I got my hopes up for. Why did I ever except them to stay true to their words and be there for me? I texted 2 of them, telling them that I cant get myself out of bed and can only mindlessly watch youtube videos. Even explictly told them ""I want to die. I really need help, I need a hug"" for the first time in my life. But guess what? They replied 6h later...one with a sticker and the other friend with a ""jyz"" (which means all the best)... So I gave up, been crying the past 2 days now, unable to do anything productive at all...and my exam is in 8 hours. I'm so screwed, I'm so stressed, and yet I can't seem to help myself at all. I didnt respond to their messages since yesterday, and they didnt even bother to text back. Especially considering that my last messages to them were just simple cries for help...they didnt bother. Perhaps they wouldnt even bat an eyelid if I had commited suicide right then, they wouldnt even have known. I guess nobody really cares about us. I dont even know why I bother trying anymore. I really want to leave this world so bad already. There isnt a point in living when everything is just to bleak now. I've been feeling like all my smiles and laughters have been diminishing more lately, and every action seems so fake and forced. The only reason why I'm still breathing today is my mom. She can be overprotective and not understanding at times, but she is the only one in my life who has really been accepting of me, trying her best to be there for me even though she fails at it (we have quite different thinkings, so her attempts to care for me go against my desires, creating conflicts instead) Other than that, I've no reason to live. My dad and sister will live fine without me. In fact, my death would be a burden off their shoulders. And I have digressed...sigh I don't know what to do anymore. I wonder if true happiness really exists. Do people actually feel happy in life? Is happiness really achievable? Anyone got tips on how to get rid of emotions and not care about friendships anymore? All I want is to be independent and never give a shit about others anymore. Giving is detrimental. I'm much better off alone and emotionless. I honestly wish that the world will end soon and all humans will be obliterated from this god forsaken hell hole. (I'm not religious in any way, in fact, I'm an atheist. ""god forsaken"" is just a phrase, so please don't start giving me well wishes based on religions...like honestly, some people need to understand that not everyone likes to be blessed by your faith, especially when we dont believe in it. It just feels like you're forcing your religion on us when you bring in religion to everything...AND AGAIN. DIGRESSION. I am sorry. But no I'm not religiously discriminatory. I understand and accept that you have your own beliefs. And that is why I wish you would apply the same respect for mine, and others who feel the same way as I do.)
ANYWAYS friendships suck and I need advice on how to stop caring about others. I've always been seen as a very happy person who loves to help others, and I dont want to be that person anymore. I no longer want to fake my smiles and enthusiasm everywhere I go. I no longer want to give a piece of my heart to everyone, caring for everyone elses' needs. Why should I bother if nobody else cares anyways? I'll just silently continue waiting for my inevitable death. I'm a little closer to it with every passing second.",1
"my boyfriend broke up with me, we had a toxic relationship… we both weren’t so great for each other despite our best efforts. i know it was probably for the best but i’m so upset. i can’t talk and i can’t feel? i’m just numb. i love him and i want to be with him but he wasn’t doing me well, i felt trapped sometimes, scared 
im not sure if he loves me or not, from a lot of his actions you would think he doesn’t actually love me and just wants to own me like an object. at this point i think im just not meant to find the right person, i just keep coming out of relationships more and more traumatized, depressed and hurt

I'll turn 22 next month and I still haven't changed from the past 6 years. Every time I think of something I can do I can also think of 100 ways that it will go wrong and it just stops me from even trying. I can't count how many times I've repeated these same words online. I'm so sick of this. I couldn't even plan my attempt because I'm also scared of it failing but I also just don't want to live like this anymore. It's so exhausting.,1

"When dealing with depression and anhedonia, where normal things that used to bring you joy no longer do, where everything is boring and dull, I still think about the future to give me a false premise of hope that one day I'll be back to being my old self and being better, I imagine myself going out making friends, getting a job that I enjoy, maybe even finding a partner, but these are all fantasies, and I'm confident that I'll never be happy in those situations all of the time. My future appears to be bleak. When I'm locked in a numbing routine where I never feel any pleasure from anything, I take solace in the fact that one day I'll perish and no longer be plagued by this nothingness I call my existence.",1
"(TW: S Assault, Drugs ect) 

I've been trying to quit alchohol this past year after I became an alcoholic during the 2 years of UK lockdown, I was drinking Rum several times a week with other drinks and substances as I was struggling badly being alone after a harsh breakup just as lockdown began and away from all my family.

It was impossible to explain how truly alone and broken I felt but around new year I began to try and quit, its not been easy as most my friends nearby also drank to numb their own pains and none of us helped eachother.

I managed to quit other substances officially 4 month ago now with honestly no urge to get any as the people I hung around were the only reason I ever got it, now I realize I was peer pressured and was desperate to not be alone.

I did manage to not drink for almost a month but the person who broke my heart beginning of lockdown proved they still don't truly care about me and screwed with my head and heart once again leaving me now traumatised by the concept of a relationship. I push everyone away now who even remotely gets emotionally close.. And I've begun binge drinking to the point I'm black out drunk, spending hundreds in just a few hours to numb how I truly feel.

4 days ago I went somewhere with a friend and did it again, I've no memory of the end of the night except for small fractions of it, but apparently a man tried sexually assaulting me and touching me whilst I was almost unconscious on the floor. My friend managed to get rid of him and get me into a taxi home...

I've had moments like this in the past where I'm drunk and can't recall anything, endangering me.

I've got BPD and Asperges and my sense of danger entirely disappears when I'm drunk, I'm practically a toddler in those moments with childish thoughts and no thought on how I might get hurt or lead astray.

Moments ago I refused to go drinking with one of my friends who is a ""proud"" alcoholic. Explaining to him what happened to me and all he said was ""fair play""... My friends list is almost none existent now as I realize how toxic the people I know are and although each day I feel alone and broken I don't want to spend my life hiding in my apartment looking down the neck of a bottle.

I've took up new hobbies, doing work training, started streaming.. Im doing everything and anything I possibly can to distract me and try to give my life purpose even though I'm now more alone than I ever was in lockdown.

I'm really going to need some luck here..",1
"I feel so worthless and I don't know how to change that . I feel that I am wasting my life , I see other people in my age that do things with their lives and have accomplished stuff and my only accomplishment is that I can drink 1 bottle of wine just by myself in one night. I use alcohol as a medicine and I feel like I need it so much in my everyday life ,but I hate myself about it because I know it's wrong . My therapist says that I should visit her more times in a week but I don't have money to support this .
I hate the world I live in . I constantly feel insecure about my friends . I hate myself because I feel like I don't have real problems and I am just being a drama queen.I feel the need to talk but when I go out with my friends I really don't want to talk about this shit.",1

I hate my success and arrogance and the fact that I would have despised my current self years ago. I hate that I gained confidence by pretending to have it and it just stuck with me. I hate it that by hating myself, but pretending not to, I can achieve things I couldn't imagine before and they are all meaningless at the end, and everything is built on a lie.",1

I'm losing sleep and feeling like I'm losing bits of my mind each night now. I wish I knew what caused it. Maybe it has something to do with me wanting to have a friend to talk to or be in another relationship, I'm not really sure. 

I just wish they would stop happening, I'm not in the best mentality to be dealing with things that were out of my control in the first place.",1
"This will probably be a long text, but I just have to let it out, and I feel like maybe someone here can help me.

Two years ago I lost someone that I truly loved with all my heart, in a way I never thought it would be able to love someone. When that person suddenly was gone, it killed me. I never thought of myself as an emotional person, but that just absolutely killed me inside. 

I was deeply depressed for months, couldnt eat, couldnt focus, couldnt sleep, the only thing I could do was cry. I think most of you can relate to what I describe. After a couple of months things got better, I mean, I was still thinking about this person all day long, I still felt extreme pain inside all the time, but it still wasnt as extreme as the first couple of months. 

I still cried regularly, maybe every couple of weeks. Then came the 1 year date to the day I lost this person. The whole day was somewhat normal, which kind of surprised me, but in the evening I had an absolute breakdown. I just cried for hours, and hours, and hours, and felt like I was thrown one year back to the exact day i lost them. 

More months go by, I cry less and less, I still feel the pain every day, I still think of this person every day, It feels like I will never forget them, which, to be honest, I would never even want to. 

A few days ago was the second year date of the day I lost them. I expected all week to just have another breakdown again on this day, I was absolutely expecting it. Then the day came, and .... nothing. It felt like every other day. I waited for the evening... nothing. I didnt cry. Not a single tear. I was never even close to crying. 

It feels like I cant even cry about it anymore. It still hurts all the time, but I just dont cry anymore. That should be good right? But somehow I even feel bad about not crying anymore. I feel like I SHOULD cry, at least once a year on that day, but I just didnt. I couldnt.

I dont know what to do, I dont even really know why I´m telling you this. Not crying anymore should be a sign that I am getting over it and moving on, which should be great, but deep inside I know thats not it, im not moving on, i never will, the pain is never going away, never getting less, im just getting used it more and more every day till the day that I die.",1
"I've been dealing extremely toxic and abusive parents both physically and emotionally I also have been dealing with severe depression and anxiety since I was 15 at 17 my best and only friend committed suicide the fact that I found her body has left me with PTSD as well as alot of guilt.

So I'm putting a stop to them.

"Here are words for words what he told me :

- spending time with you is a waste of time.

- when we see eachother it prevents us of from doing anything else (like gaming)

- when you call me, most of the time you really piss me off (I used to call him every 3 days)

- you talk for nothing, you beat around the bush

- you are invested in our relationship while I don't really care about it

- if our relationship works it's great but if it doesn't I don't care 

- you're taking all my time (only seeing each other once a week)

- when you talk to me I feel like you just want to disturb me

"Hello.

I know my post will kind of stick out because it is not about me. But I'm really concerned. I apologize in advance for the long read, but I want to point out as many details as I can.

I'm 16, and there's this girl in my class whom I'm very worried about. I won't lie, I like her a lot. When we were like 10 we used to be very close friends, but I was an asshole back then and always treated her like garbage. She eventually distanced from me, but I know that was very hard for her since she's always been an extremely good person. Honestly, she's been a role-model for me ever since I realised how awful of a person I was.

Coincidentally, the year after she """"""""abandoned"""""""" me, they mixed the groups on our classes, and we didn't go together for four years. In that time, a lot has changed for her, that's for sure. She's made new friends, but as the years passed she's been increasingly quiet, and oftentimes she appears to not be very integrated in whichever group she's in.

Last year, because of Covid, some of our classes were given on her classroom and viceversa. There, their mentor made their students hang a piece of paper explaining how they felt overall. I was heartbroken, because, of course, I read hers, and she wrote that she was sad because somebody made her suffer a lot in the past. Obviously, it might not be me, but honestly, I did terrible things to her, so she probably refered to me. I don't think she hates me, but it's obvious she'd rather be with anybody else than me.

This year, they mixed us up again, and at last I'm with her. I haven't talked to her, but I've been observing her, and I hate what I've seen so far. She's very lonely. Last year, she was in a large group of people, and yes, she was kind of isolated there, too, but at least she had some social interaction. You could see her laughing, occasionally speaking, you know? She was there. Now, that big group has dissolved into much smaller groups, but she isn't part of any of those groups. On breaks, she stays in class and does her homework, but when she doesn't have homework, she also stays in class, but sits alone and does nothing. She often looks sadly through the window during the whole break and it's honestly heartbreaking. Very occasioanlly, some of her old friends speak to her, and I can tell that makes her feel better. She's always been so cheerful, and endearing, and seeing her now, so lonely, it genuinely makes me lose sleep.

However. There's one person that is often with her. It's a boy that literally nobody likes. Like, nobody at all. I feel bad having to say this, but he's EXACTLY like Berdly from Deltarune. That boy also has a crush on her, so he spends quite some time with her, but from what I heard, she's sick of him, because he's very annoying. That boy does nothing to make her feel better, because other people's feelings are not important to him. In fact, he probably makes her feel worse. He's always bragging and talking about his and only his things. She is too nice to do anything about him, so she lets him be with her, but, if possible, she tries her best to avoid him altogether.

That's not all, though. She's a good student, not the best in the class, but certainly above average. She usually gets 7-9. That's quite good, but her older sister was a freaking genius. I heard she got a 10 in like, everything. She probably believes that the bar's too high for her and is worried about that. And man do I know this feeling, the same thing happens to me with my sister. I believe she has strict parents. I've seen them a couple times, and they are always serious. I've never seen them smile. I'm sure her parents expect her to be like her sister, even though she's not, and that probably makes her feel very badly about herself. She probably does not trust herself and has low self-esteem because of that. We do Religion in our school, and one day, the teacher made us write on the blackboard compliments that we'd love to recieve. She wrote things like ""You can do it!"" or ""I believe in you!""... She just wants somebody to be proud of her. She also wants to feel useful. This week we had to craft and decorate little carboard stars which will be given to kids with cancer. She was striving so hard, running around, giving material to everyone who needed it, painting a lot, throwing remains of cardboard in the trash... I'm confident she worked harder than everybody else, and nobody said anything to her. That seems to be a recurring thing in her life.

She probably feels like nobody cares about her. Last year it was the last year of a school stage, so we did this scruffy ""graduation"", organized by some people of our class. They gave everybody a graduation bar with a funny nickname... except for her. They literally forgot about her. She said she did not care, but something tells me that's not true. I'd feel terrible if that happened to me. The last day of the previous year, everyone was hugging each other and wishing a nice summer. She left without saying anything to anyone, and that made me very sad, because, of course, nobody cared. Today I've noticed she deleted her Instagram account, which inspired me to write this post. That was the last straw.

I feel very bad about her. She's obviously not happy with her life. I'm not sure if she's depressed, but I cannot discard that as a possibility. To be honest, I wrote this post here because I know I'll get good advice, anyways. 

I'd do anything to help her, but I'm afraid to get near her, because she probably still suffers because of what I did to her. I apologized some years ago, but that's not something that gets fixed by just saying ""I'm sorry"". My apology was probably useless. I want to redeem myself with her. I want to be the guy who tells her that he's proud of her. I want to let her cry it all out. I want to be there for her 24/7. I want to get her to answer honestly if I ask her ""How are you?"". But... How do I do it? How do I approach her? She probably knows I like her, and I don't want her to feel like I'm just approaching her because I like her. I want her to know I'm there for her. This school stage only lasts two years, and then comes University, which means we'll get separated forever. I want to be the reason she remembers our school fondly, not the catalyst of her suffering. But two years are nothing. I need to act quick. What can I do?

I was talking to a guy which I’m sure at this point never liked me and was only using me because he knew I had a thing for him. I’m a virgin and he knew that and I feel like he was taking advantage of me sexually due to the attraction. 

When I’m depressed I tend to retreat away to manage my feelings without it impacting others but then I feel like it makes my depression worse cause then I realized who actually wants to talk to me. 

I just feel like my life is caving in on me. Like no matter what I do not one part of my life has a current positive state other than my health and being alive for the most part.

"No where else to turn to for advice or help on my current situation. My daily life and health are comprising and I’m trying to fix things but nothing is working.

So instead of picking up old habits I started taking the gym more seriously and trying to count calories/macros to help reach a healthy status but my appetite comes and goes. as I try every possible avenue to keep my mind off things I’ll get hungry, sometimes to point where my stomach is growling, and once I have a bite or two, my appetite dissipates. It’s pretty annoying honestly wasting such food. I even picked up a new hobby to keep my mind occupied but I somehow figured a way to lie to myself to bring the situation into my new hobby. I have been spending more time taking my dog on long walks but I’m thinking about the situation the whole time. And last night was the final straw for me that made me realize I need help.

"I am writing this here because I feel like it is the best place for me to start a dialogue and feel like people will listen without judging me.
I feel all alone and I feel like I do not have anyone to talk to about my depression/anxiety. It is the most horrible experience I go through and it has gradually worsened over the past few years. At the moment of writing this, I woke up feeling alone but there are other feelings too. The worst part of my feeling alone is that, I have so many friends and family that I know love me, but I feel as if, if they really knew how I feel they would think I’m crazy. I am not able to tell anyone this is how I feel about this and that is how I feel about that because my thoughts are really dark. These feelings arise from my past relationships with partners, family and friends. All the time I wish I could tell people how I really feel inside but I think it would push so many people away from me and it makes me scared of truly being alone as if me being depressed makes me a bad person and someone not nice to be around. Also, for those who really care about me, I do not want them to feel as if they have failed me or feel my pain because it might hurt them too, so I keep everything bottled up. Even as I write this I cry because I feel like everything in my life has gotten to me. Regret is perhaps the most horrible feeling that I deal with everyday. After a certain event happened, I looked back at life and every action I took where I thought I wanted to do something different troubles me. When I muse over this, there are so many events I can recall and the most horrible thought is when it relates to people who have hurt me, the actions that are small and everyday actions to them that have hurt me, but are insignificant for them. However, the lasting impact has stayed with me for life, I usually think of things which have happened as far 10 or even 20 years ago and have so many regrets and wish I had taken a different action at that point but you can never go back in time which also upsets me. This leads me to my next thought. The only time I truly feel happy is when I am away from everyone; friends, family the whole lot. I have responsibilities, so I can never fully leave but it truly makes me happy when I feel like I can be my true self and take the actions that I want to take. I can be a different person than what those who care about me want me to or expect me to be. I can feel like a new person, as if my past didn’t exist and all those regrets I have are from a different life. All I need to do is focus on the present and the future.

"(17M) This is a long rant, because I feel the need to express it.

 Why do I fucking make decisions I can't possibly keep. It happens randomly when I have a slight dopamine rush, I tell people something I decided (always fucking just now) to change or do, depending on the situation I either explain exactly why, in details, I've decided to change or just literally tell someone I'm free to do a certain thing.

Every single time I successfully make myself believe I'll do it and I'm motivated about doing just that, until it gets to me and I regret. There's things I've said I'd start doing or stop. I don't ever so I look like a liar and because of that I have to modify what I said.

And there's things I can't fucking go back on without risking to lose the trust, something I need or the relationship.

In only the past 3 weeks, I have said or said I would do:

- I would stop smoking weed and sell related stuff (Said to my parents and friends, because they were available to text and I needed to)// friday of the same week, hit a bong at a party, all of those friends were, about 5 times.

- Told the teacher of the only course I have right now I would from now on be at school everytime I can. // Actually only went back once a week since then for an hour so I wouldn't get kicked out

- Picked a new shift on the friday at the place I work at on the sunday and can already barely fucking handle. // Ain't no way I can back out without losing the job.

- Told a friend I wanted to work together on a project ""we're both interested in"" // lost interest the same week.

- Told parents I figured out what I wanted to study. // guess what

- etc.


What the fuck do I always need to make myself suffer more. It's exactly like I need to eliminate every possible things I still have to get me going. I'm causing myself more pain and worry and feel like I have absolutely no control over this.

I don't sleep enouhh anymore and go more than a day without sleeping multiple times a week, I have little to no hobbies left. All I have left I really care about are relationships, I'm slowly ruining.

I’m the most depressed I’ve ever been. I keep having seizures. I’m in so much pain. My meds aren’t working. I’m basically Stuck in bed. I’m going to go. Just wanted to say good bye,1
"I never thought I would be here, but here I am. I'm so tired of everyone's overall complete lack of empathy for others regarding everything. For almost my whole life, I have always enjoyed the things I liked on my own as I was always much more comfortable without others, just minding my own passions and ideas because there was almost nobody in my life who ever had the same interests and/or ideas as me.

I just don't understand for why is everyone so obsessed with acting horrible to others, like what do you even gain from that? It blows my mind to see everyone else laughing everyday meanwhile I'm just sitting there minding my own business wondering where did I go so wrong, as to why does everyone has someone or something that they can relate to meanwhile I am always the only one who has to deal with these things that no one else does.

I have very few people in my life that I can deeply relate with, but those people are from another country and I only see them a few hours once per week IF I am lucky. And to top it all off, I'll also be moving to another country where I'll probably never see them often like once per 1-2 weeks ever again.

I genuinely just do not understand what did I do wrong. It feels like everyone else is just much more successful and happy than me overall and here I am, wondering where did I go so wrong.

For years, I've argued with people on such moral topics on social relationship matters, but what is even the point if there's barely anyone even looking at you when you say hello?

Even the more frustrating part is that YOU are instantly the villain the moment you do not meet their standards as they make you the outcast who no one talks with. It's really funny cause If I chose to be myself they would do the exact same either way.

I don't want to sound too prideful, but it really sometimes feels like I'm the only one who knows the ''truth of life'' meanwhile the rest are just idiots (yes, I meant that) who are simply too blind and ignorant to be willing to be kind to each other in this already cruel world that ruins us everyday enough. I'm not claiming to know that I know everything in life as life has no specific meaning, but you get my point.

Sorry guys, having a bad day where everything comes on top of each other.

"A few weeks back I think I was in a bad way. I was admitted to hospital. On deaths door. Wanted out and hated life. After countless phone calls to numerous people saying 'we'll get someone in a contact with you' over and over again I just thought fuck you useless cunts and you bloody piss taking waiting game you're making me sit through. I did some research and asked my veterans support worker and he told me about a book by professor Paul Gilbert called 'overpowering depression' 3rd edition. It's looks like a clinical book and this isn't an answer to everyone because it focuses on cognitive behavioural therapy and some people don't take to that. Look I'm still not 100% but it's helping. Maybe someone might read this and be more suited to reading about their condition. First part explains the different types and how to body responds to depression. 2 and 3 parts help use techniques to control the responses.

This might help someone. It helped me.",1
"30\M, east coast of the US.

I am currently on 60mg Prozac for MDD. It took about 5 weeks to take effect after a dosage increase. I was able to feel happiness and had positive view on things. It wassomethibg I haven’t felt for a while. I was doing good, but out of nowhere I started to push people close to me away. I’ve been seeing a therapist and she asked me why a self sabotage myself? I know I have that voice inside my head that tells me I don’t deserve it. I’m truly trying to learn how to self love, but when I see myself, I see someone unwanted and broken. People who reaches out gives up on me because I push them away. I don’t like being like that, but apparently it’s a defense mechanism to avoid getting hurt. What can I do to be able to open up to others and genuinely accept compliments and their hand when they reach out?",1
"my days become a complete blur by night or the next day, i never know what day it is, i keep forgetting to take certain pills, i feel so slow. i feel like i’m not paying attention, like i’m barely there. i used to be good at listening and being in the moment, but i can’t focus, my brain just starts to blur and i can’t multitask anymore. i’m tired all the time and i don’t want to take care of myself i just want to sleep forever. not even die, just sleep. and dream. and be in my warm bed in silence. i’m so fucking tired",1

"I am writing here.. I have no motivation, I cry all day, I feel useless, worthless, that something is wrong with me. I don't know if I can call that depression, I am the kind to think that someone is living something worse than me and I am kinda a fraud.. don't ask me why.. but I do feel like shit (sorry for my language) and that's not the first time. 10 years ago I was also in this state but I was able to get out of it and felt strong. The difference today is.. I am not sure I am strong anymore, I try everything but always end back were I started and I am tired.. I just feel I just can't.. I am expecting nothing.. just needed to write somewhere",1
"Just needed to vent. I feel worn out and alone. Just mentally and emotionally. I just started a new job and idk if it's the right fit. Just trying to fit in with my new co workers and different pace than I'm used to.. 

Also feel like I'm always there for my friends who are never there for me back. Family is there a little of the time. Though I'm there for everyone when they need it. It drains you being nice all the time.. Videogames and Soccer are my outlets were I can usually de stress or at least feel happy momentarily. Lately though my friends or thereof make me feel like the odd one out in both.. so its starting to get to me more and more.",1
"I just need some help to understand why I'm feeling this constant need to just be at home and do nothing. Honestly I have plenty reasons to not be happy with the stuff that's been going around in my life the past year. Starting with the fact that I've always struggled with obesity and have come to hate myself for it. I was successful in losing 60 pounds in the past 15 months but I've already gained more than half of it back in the recent months. I have a very damaged relationship with my mother and my brother, it's been like that ever since we lost my father a few years ago, while they share a completely normal relationship with each other, maybe I'm the problem I guess. To add on to this recently (around a year ago) I had developed some feelings for my best friend, she didn't feel the same way, which is okay, but then a few months after I had confessed my feelings I introduced her to one of my closest childhood friends (from another group) and despite knowing about my feelings they decided to get together, which again is okay I guess as who am I to stop them (neither did I try to, I just distanced myself from them) but it just made feel like shit. All of this has been happening but yet I've never felt the urge to just lay in my bed and do nothing, in fact when I've tried I've actually managed to feel normal, hence never felt the need to not go out or to not socialise. And I don't understand why but lately I've just started shutting myself off. I hate talking to people, I hate having to put up that superficial smile, I literally hate just the thought of getting off my bed. Although, I do gather myself and go to work everyday, and once I reach there's absolutely no way anyone will be able to tell that I haven't felt happy lately. Even when I do meet my friends, there's no way they'll be able to tell. I find it okay to act fine when I'm around people. Can someone help me understand what the hell is wrong with me? And how do I fix it?",1
I did this to myself. I deserve it. I just can't believe it. It doesn't feel real. I'm shodowbanned on here for some reason. I'm ready to die.,1
"23/M 
Lost my job but have zero motivation to get another. All the bills are piling up as I type this but all I can do is sit in a blank stare for days and keep asking myself how I ended up in this situation. I have no supportive friends or family but I think it’s because I pushed them away just so I can be in silence. I have this physical pain in my chest daily, I’m tired of feeling empty. I don’t know if I want to live. I keep telling myself things will get better but I just want to unalive myself and be done. I don’t know if growing old is worth it anymore. I have no goals or interests. I’m just a empty shell that’s full of pain and misery.",1
"So today I moved out of my parents house for the second time. The first time I moved out it was a bit more than a year ago. My GF (ex now) and I got an apartment together. We broke up, I moved back in with my parents after the lease ended. The breakup destroyed me. Everyday for 6 months the one thing that was on my mind was suicide. My dad proved to me numerous times that he didn’t care what I felt, same with my brother so that just made it worse. My mom cared, but she was busy working all the time so I don’t blame her for trying to help me. My dog was the only one that gave me unconditional love at the time, and it honestly really helped me start to feel a bit better. Eventually I decided that I would be better off moving out again. This time I moved out with my friend and his GF, 4 hours away from where I used to live. I just got done moving all my stuff in today, and I miss my dog so much I can’t even describe the feeling. He’s getting old, and I’m afraid that he might die while I’m away and it makes me so sad. I was really the only one that would actually care for him, take him on walks, pet him, make him feel loved. Now that I’m gone I’m afraid that he’s going to think I abandoned him, and that he won’t get the attention that he deserves. I feel like I’m nothing without my dog. My emotions are running so high right now, I really just feel extremely lonely, and honestly can’t stop thinking about killing myself. Forgot to mention I’m 21 M. Thanks for taking the time to let me vent",1

"I really need a hug, I feel like everything's crumbling, pain is everywhere and my body hurts so emotionally. My BF is long distance and I don't have much friends and my weighted blanket was lost. My emotional support teddy bear isn't helping anymore and I feel like harming myself to stop this emotional pain I'm feeling. Pillows, teddy bears, blankets etc. aren't enough, what do I do? I can't just hug a stranger. I just need to feel weight against me, like maybe I could use a piece of furniture to hold? I don't know anymore and it's just getting worse, and it's not touch starved, it's just physical comfort.",1
"How do I kill myself in a manner that’s quick and relabel painless? I have never shot a gun before so I’m afraid I’ll mess that up. Plus it’s too messy. I kinda wanna seem like I just fell asleep. Go somewhere far away from my home town and just wait to die in a very secluded place. I don’t want my body found because I don’t care to be remembered, have a funeral, be celebrated….nothing. I just want to cease to exist and for my name to just become an old memory. I’m not special or worth anything or any troubles now and I don’t want ppl to act like I am when that I’m dead. I want to die as lonely as I have lived and once I’m gone, for it to seem as tho I never even existed. I don’t need encouragement. There’s nothing anyone can do to change my mind that I need to die. It’s for the best. I just need help doing it bc I’ve failed trying to overdose multiple times",1

"I'm depressed, sad, overwhelmed, scared. I need someone genuine who wants to help, who cares about me as a person and who can deal with my difficulties but also my happiness that peaks out every so often. The reason I look for older men is because I don't bond well with women (but I also don't usually get responses from women older than me so maybe that's an option) and I need wisdom from people who have lived.",1
"I have had those thoughts for quite a while now, but not only thoughts, also planning on how to do it, if i would do it. I feel like if i do not speak about it in the near future, something bad will happen. I do not have a therapist because i havent had the guts to look for someone. But i do have difficulties with communicating my Problems, thoughts, fears etc in general. 
Telling my parents, friends, sibling about my thoughts would not be the best idea i think.. so i was thinking about telling my family doctor about it, as he is somewhat aware of my problems.. but how do i do it? I probably break down in tears telling him something like that and i dont want to cry.. how can i navigate the conversation in this direction? Can i just write a note so he can read it and then he asks me about it? 
Oh i really dont know what to do..",1
"It just seems so freeing to have nothing else to worry about. No money, no stress, nothing. I'm also curious about what comes next after we die. There's just so much about this world that we don't know.

"I was diagnosed way before I got addicted to drugs. When my best friend took his own life and I attempted to end mine and the trauma of abuse as a child caught up with me, I used to keep from hurting myself. It hurt every second and getting high was my only escape. Three years ago I ended my five year opioid addiction after multiple overdoses. Yet I’ve realized I’ll never be the same. How do I accept that? How do I accept that no matter how long I take medicine to stay sober, no matter how fucking hard I try, the damage us already done. I pissed away my future and all I wanted to do is to not hurt myself. I fucked my life up more trying to cope. How do I accept that",1
"I’m a university student in my early 20s who has really had some tough times and have come very close to taking my own life. Got a pet rabbit a little while ago and I just vibe in my room with her on the floor without a care in the world. Has helped bring structure and responsibility to my life. Sounds kind of dumb but seriously. If you were considering getting a pet before, get one. Completely underrated way of managing stress and helping with depression.",1
"Even when I was younger I cared little about everything family,friends etc thinking it was a normal mindset not like I didn’t have any friends in fact I’d say I was well liked at school I’m 19 and tbh I still just don’t care I’m pretty much about to be homeless and just couldn’t care less I understand why family and friends and things are important just don’t feel any attachment towards anything like I could leave and never come back and in everything I do it’s like I’m not even enjoying myself but I still act like I am. I’ve tried everything basketball,football,tennis,cricket,rugby,studying hard, drugs, games, cooking, working and tbh nothing does it I could kill myself now tbh but I still know there are people who love me this has been a very long term mindset and now I’m just bored and fed up 

I know it’s very weird thing just wondering if anyone can help",1
"Past year I finished uni, have wife, kid and dog. Got my self a decent job. But feel like I am worhless all the time.
I have had this feeling from time to time since I was a kid. But never ever have I felt this bad as I felt past months. I know that taking care of myself by going to the gym, eat healthy, sleep regularly and meet friends wold help.
Because I've done it. But now it feels like I am not willing to make things better for me.
I would for some reason would rather be self pity myself and resent everyone around me. I really hate my parents how they raised me. And I blame them for how mentally ill I am. And the worst part is, they did there best.",1
"I've been so stressed lately with school and grades and university admissions. And honestly, I kind of want everything to become bad again. I dont know why. I know I should be grateful that I'm doing better now, and I should focus on that, but I'm tired of trying so hard to get better and to force myself to not go back to a terrible state. I'm tired of constantly worrying, and I know that atleast if everything become bad again, I won't care about anything anymore. And I'd rather have that then this constant worrying and trying and just getting more and more scared of the future.

If I give up, I wouldn't care about school and grades anymore, and so it wouldn't matter if they were bad at all, and the idea of not caring about school is so enticing I'd rather just completely give up on my mental health. Because then atleast I'd have an excuse.

I don't even know what I want anymore. I just wish I was never in this position in the first place. I keep telling myself that if only I tried harder, if only I got better grades, if only I didn't change school, and it just makes me feel so much worse. And it makes me feel like even though we had a whole pandemic going on and I literally wanted to die, everybody else still got good grades, so why can't I? Especially now, when I'm better.

I'm just so scared of the future. I'm so scared about university applications and my high school transcript. I'm so scared of getting bad grades. I'm so scared of getting rejected. And I just want to give up.",1
"Hello all, 

I suffered from repeated depression since the age of 21 and have been in a depression for the better part of 3 years, mostly due to work related problems, though not exclusively. But the last 2-3 months have been very good, and I think I haven’t felt this good in years. I even told this to my psychiatrist 1 ½ weeks ago, but I was on vacation back then. Since returning to work this Thursday my supervisor has returned to backstabbing and bullying me again and the quantity of my work is just too much for me to deal with and I feel like shit again and had a severe mood drop. 

Has any of you guys ever experienced such rapid mood swings, like you’ve gone from feeling great to utter shit within a few days? This rapid decrease of my mood is really making me very anxious. I am solely diagnosed with depression and not with BPD or bipolar disorder, just for clarification.

I’d like to get an appointment with my psychiatrist again, but I fear that he might feel mocked or played by me as I told him last week that I feel so great at the moment. What should I do I am at my witts end and totally overwhelmed. I’m thankful for any advice. 

TLDR: From feeling great to feeling shit within a week. What to do?",1

"recently i started taking antidepressants, they worked… so i stopped taking them. 

i spent ages 11 to 18 wallowing in the pits of my depression. i never developed any hobbies, made future plans, tried to do anything with my life. i didn’t think i would live to see 16, but then i did. 

i don’t think i can bring myself to take antidepressants again. at least if i’m depressed i have something to distract myself. the thought of being an empty shell of a person is way more horrifying then being perpetually depressed.",1
"I’ve been in a depressive episode for about 6-8 months now, and I’ve noticed it really has taken a toll on my libido. I’m a 17 year-old heterosexual male, and I’d be lying if I told you sex wasn’t once on my mind a lot, but now my drive has just gone completely. I masturbate on the odd occasion, but only so that my minimal sex-drive can be one less inconvenience in my life for a few days - a week.

Sometimes, even the thought of having sex makes me feel sad. It is also affecting my ability to explore relationships with people; I am in close-contact with a wonderful girl at the moment, and I am thankful for I love her company. However, I have such minimal sexual desire, which makes things a little awkward in that regard. I don’t want to disappoint anybody, but at the moment I feel I would.

I don’t believe sex is the only reason why heterosexual men form a close-bond with women, but it is often at least partially so. Of course - I have female friends, and with friendship this lack of sexual-drive is obviously irrelevant. But if I were to go on a date, for example, I feel with such a dampened sex-drive I may come across as dull or uninterested. Having a libido provides an incredible sense of incentive and sociability when forming the beginning of a relationship with someone that just isn’t there anymore.",1

"(Allow me to start by saying that I know my current circumstances are nowhere near as dire as those others I have seen here, but I didn't know where else to go and my parents think I am doing great and I don't want to tell them because they don't get it)

As of today I think I am officially suffering from mild depression. When I prepared to come to college everyone hyped it up and I did my best to fit in. I dieted, lost weight, tried super hard so far to fit in, I even dropped my album on Spotify before getting in just so I’d have something to show off. When I got here I joined any club I was interested in, talked to as many people as possible, tried out for things and so far I’ve made a couple friends from my orientation group and my roommates/ neighbors.

However, now it’s almost the end of my first semester (I'm a transfer btw), I haven’t had fun since my second week here, with the increasing workload it feels as if I’m being suffocated that I am barely able to keep ahead of, I’ve gained 12 pounds, I don’t sleep well and I’ve dropped every club I was apart of rather quickly as well as lost touch with some of my friends and roommates. Don’t get me wrong no one hates me, but I tried so hard in the beginning to find people I vibe with and so far I’ve really found only like 1, maybe? I think my problem stems from high school where I was a part of a team sport, had lots of friends and got invited to things constantly. I tried so hard to avoid the opposite but while one part of me loves my major and the work for it, it feels as if I have to choose between it and having a social life at this point. I don’t get invited to parties anymore, bar outings with my roommates, or anywhere for that matter except to go eat more fried food from the campus cafeteria. Call me crazy, but I had this stupid dream that I was going to come here and be able to establish some friends, join a club or two, and maybe find someone I like romantically and see where that goes and have a great overall time going out and having fun while learning and accomplishing my goals… 

But while I sit alone in my dorm typing this pathetic cry for help on another empty and lonely Saturday night, I feel like shit. No one I’ve met has heavily interested me at all and while I feel like every time I set foot out of my room or interact with anyone I have to put on a mask of happiness just to fit in. Many people don’t share the same interests as me (rap music, anime, gaming), all of the clubs so far don’t interest me and of the ones that did (Asian clubs) I’ve pretty much been alienated because while I’m from Asian descent and was raised in a semi Asian household, I don’t necessarily look it at all and because of that the people I want to be friends with the most take one look at me and I automatically feel the vibe that no one wants to talk to me. (Trust me, I tried everything with them but I got tired of being ignored every single time)

I used to be so sociable, make friends easy, and while I can still turn that part of me on to meet people, the connections I used to be able to make with strangers just seem dead. Literally everyday feels so empty and meaningless outside of my major’s homework and I feel like the odd one out. It feels like how most people describe hellish high school experiences, trying to fit in. They say that college is supposed to be the place where you can stand out and find your tribe, but why does it feel like I’m more caged than ever around people that share nothing in common with me.

Maybe it just needs time? It is only my first semester but I just feel like as I watch everyone’s posts and stories online that I’ve met who are also new transfers, I just want to die inside. They seem to be having so much fun while I'm here alone again.

How do you make friends? How do you approach people? I remember when I could talk to someone for a couple of seconds and immediately know if I vibed with them, but it’s been so long since I've felt that I can't tell if its me or just everyone I've met. All I do is eat and eat and eat and eat, then get pissed at myself for eating which makes me eat more. The weight packs on while the people around me continue to tell all of their crazy party stories and the people they’ve met. I’ve never been the one to initiate a hangout so maybe that’s the problem? I don’t know, at this point I’m just rambling about my feelings and shit posting. It feels good to get it out though.

And I know my issues are definitely not as bad as some of the others on here, but this is the first time in a long time where I feel like the success of my future and all my hopes and dreams feel worthless. It feels like no matter what direction I go I’ll never make it to the top, I’ll never have more fun than I already did years ago, never be better, never do something amazing because I constantly put everyone else around me on a pedestal. For the first time life feels empty and while I know an infinite amount of college parties and drunken nights won't make a difference when I'm 50, it feels like all the fun times are over and I spent most of that time working hard and prepping for college when everyone else was having fun between high school and transferring.

Right now I really just don't want to exist.

But for anyone out there, if you remotely feel the same or have been through this, how did you do it? Is it just a matter of time before I find my crowd and life becomes fun again?

And if you’re currently going through a similar situation, you’re not alone.

If you made it to the end, I commend you for being able to read all of this. And if not, that’s totally fine, any help is appreciated.",1
"Hi I don't really know what to say but I don't really have any reason to feel the way I do really. 

I have a couple of incredible friends. And a lovely boyfriend. But I feel i always give too much and I can't help it. I will always be the one who gets hurt the most regardless. I've had suicidal thoughts for a long long time. And I'd love to just fall asleep and never wake up again. 

I was diagnosed with MS at 15 and my family are incredible but I purposely chose to move as far away as I could in the country to isolate myself. Distance myself from them so they would get used to not having me around. 9 years later and still in the place I moved to and I would give anything to be able to see my parents more but that's not possible. 

Also with money. I always do more and leave myself with very little. I pay all of the bills. And I still feel guilty for asking for a bit of help sometimes. 

My job I feel outcasted and alone. I have been treated differently because of my disability. Apparently there's nothing wrong with me because outwardly I look ""normal"". 

My brother has also recently been diagnosed with progressive MS and I feel guilty for that. Maybe it's my fault? I should've had progressive MS. I'd much rather have the worst kind and him have relapsing remitting which is my diagnosis. 

I feel like I can't talk to anyone about my true thoughts. I don't want to burden them or them feel I'm playing pity cards or attention seeking. 

I would do absolutely anything to just disappear. Every day is getting harder and I feel like a waste of oxygen. 

I couldn't even get my degree as I was in an abusive relationship at the time and he didn't let me go to university and I was subsequently asked to leave. As I was wasting everyone's time apparently. 

The only things keeping me going are my pets. I would've been long gone and forgotten if it wasn't for them. 

I'm sorry. I'll stop now. I'm sorry to bother you or take time out from those who really need it.

"Goosebumps on my skin. Cold chill down my back. My mind is on a hunger strike. Scrape more residue. Stay up 24 hrs. Sleep 24 hrs. Who cares what's the difference. Zero money. Zero drive. How am I supposed to make decisions? After I've sat in this room alone for a year and stared at pixels. And stared at the wall. How can I look at anyone in the face and tell them I have something to offer? I dont. Im done. 

Compared to so many others I shouldn't have a worry in the world. Ive had opportunities people in others countries dont get. Ive thrown it all away. Everything. Bombs fall far away from me. I have clothes and a bed. And a family that tries to help. They can't do anything though. So I just stay as far away as possible. I can not wait to die.",1
"Im a 18yo European male, your average guy who had a great childhood, graduated from high school without working and without money issues.

I think everything went great until I was 16 or so. Since then, i’ve lost all my motivation, ambition, i’ve had severals mental breakdown due to externals events and I dont feel like doing anything, I just sleep all day long or think about the past.
All my friends dont give a damn fuck when I try talking to them so I stopped trying and Im just pretending everything is okay.

Recently, I feel like I am trowing away my life. I moved in another city for studying, Its a rathole, theres nothing here i had to fight a few times here and i dont like my study at all . So the days are almost the same, i woke up, go to university, and then go home. Sometime i cry, i drink or i smoke at night the last two sadly became the best moment of the day.

And finally my girl texted me yesterday, telling me she cheated while I was gone, in 2 months she slept with almost 10 different men. It’s driving me crazy, i thought she was different, i really loved her and opened up to her, we shared so many stories together. 

Now I just keep thinking about the whole thing, my life, my future, and nothing comes to my head when I think about my i will become. At night i imagine her sleeping with an other man all nigh long, and its stopping me from sleeping.",1
"I got bullied when I was younger, and still feel incapable of truly defending myself (especially on a psychological level).

Are there resources to learn how to do this? To understand why the bullying has happened, how to stop these things, tools to do so, and training?

I looked online and can't find barely anything.",1
"I've had some real bad times since the age of 7. My mind and body respond awfully violently to whatever, and I just get horrible headaches from any sources of stress. I've been to hospital for like 8 month just because of this shit. Started to stop caring. Stayed awake 72 hours, then slept 24h. All that by doing nothing. This part of my life was so hard to come through that, aside from surviving 3 times, I still can't say what's true and what did I made up to feel better about myself. I've been lying to myself for years and I'm still trying to dissociate truth from lies.

Anyway, that's the past. The worst depression I've ever experienced. It changed me for a while. Forever I guess. After that, I couldn't find a way to be myself. I went from crying little dude, to mean and violent, to overly proud, to ... Me I guess. Started sport while trying to find myself. Never been in a better shape than when I tried to find a way to my life. I didn't eat that much so I lost weight quite easily, and I did pushups and abds everyday just to quit thinking.

I was feeling all this time that my life had no use. Then I discovered that I could make people feel better. Make them smile somehow. Make them be proud of themselves. I decided to be that guy that pushes people to be the best version of themselves. I don't know why, but it didn't stick as much as I thought it would. But hey, it keeps being one of my objectives today so, yeay.

3 years ago I started my studies in a field that made me proud of myself for the first time. It was magical. It didn't last. But it feels better to finally doing something of my mind and time.

I know my speech isn't that structured but I'm writing as my mind needs to let it out so ... Sorry for that.

Right now I'm in a pretty stable state. But it doesn't last that long. I've got like, 8-9month of feeling ... Ok or overwhelmed, and 3-4month of intense depression. I'm in that state right now. Incapable to do anything productive, paranoiac, empty, jealous, feeling like a piece of trash. The one thing that keeps my up is the fact that I know that somehow, it'll be okay. It'll be better. I don't know how but since those three years, I see a little light in the dark. I just want you all to know that, I found a little light, I don't know what that is, and it doesn't keep me from feeling like nothing 4 month a year, but this little light exist. And you can find yours too.",1
I finally worked up the courage to be honest with a close(?) friend about having depression and anxiety. I choked up telling her. After a brief pause in the conversation she kept talking about everything happening in her life. I honestly don’t know what I expected. But because “reach out” is such common mental health advice I was wondering what the hell is the point?,1
Someone that was like a 2nd mother to me died a month ago . Her memorial is tomorrow. I’ve had so many life problems going on lately . Im too depressed to attend her funeral . I think attending would make everything worse .,1
I need help. I have some though that I would be better off dead. Not that I intend on killing myself or do self harming either but I wonder if it’s normal to have these though and if it would be considered suicidal though even tho I won’t do it.,1
"I feel like I’ll never be generally loved or appreciated for who I am, I’m so lonley man, everyday is so hard I’m struggling to make it through. I want these feelings to go away, I understand that it’s a state of mind that I gotta get out of but it feels like it’s no way out and this constant suffering becomes to much. 

When I’m in a state where suicide feels like the best option for me. I’ve called the hotline but guess what they don’t give a fuck no one fucking does, they legit asked me if I was a tea or coffee drinker CUNT IM CALLING YOU SAYING I HAVE A SUICIDE PLAN. Constant social rejection, constant giving to others but receiving nothing back I’m done. 

But I’ll say this if you’re feeling the same I’d hug the shit out of you, you deserve so much better and don’t let any mofo tell you otherwise.",1
"Quick backstory, ever since I’ve adopted my buddy Sherman at a very young age at the shelter he usually accompanies me during any midnight or slightly later food cravings… as it being a weekend night he attracted a lot of attention. Ended up meeting up with some fellow industry buddies who asked me to drop their names at a restaurant that was currently needing cooks (a job I need drastically right now.) 
I didn’t want to go out today, I wrote the whole day off, and all it took was me going out at odd hours with my cat in my arms and I found a potential employer. Obviously nothing is set in stone, obviously this is a ridiculous story… 
But if it all it took was me just taking a walk for something redundant and ending up talking with people that could potentially help with finance and security issues… I suggest just taking that walk outside, message that friend you haven’t in a long time, check in on somewhere you used to work back in the day and see how they’re doing; you don’t know what can happen. 

Even if nothing happens out of it, it was the act of just getting out and putting myself in a position I normally would not have. May work, may not. Point being…

Do not under any circumstances give up. Ever. 

TL;DR: if something in your mind is telling you to shut off, accept it and understand it’s completely normal, just realize that sometimes life will throw you a bone when you are least expecting.",1
"Everything is one big cycle all day everyday until I finally get a 2 day break to be depressed a more sad. I can’t do anything my studies are difficult, my hobbies are difficult and most importantly my romantic relationship is difficult. I’m always worried by the threat of my So cheating on me because it means I’m not good enough or any of the stupid ass scenarios I make up everyday not to mention worries of if I’m even loved or if we’ll last. I thought getting into a relationship would help with depression and it does to an extent with a purpose in life along with being less insecure as for me it makes my partner like a anti depressant making everything ok around her but it cranks my anxiety up super high. I just don’t think it always was supposed to be like this.",1

every so often i'm hit with this. this sense of some huge emotion that im on the brink of that i could never name. and i want to do crazy, wild things and i want to explain it but i just can't. i want to see love and feel pain and watch the world. it's gone by the morning.",1
"I have been feeling emotionally apathetic for a while now. I cant remember the last time I felt genuine happiness or sadness and I cant build emotional connections with others. Sometimes I even wonder if i would cry when my family or close friends die, and i feel like an asshole for thinking that I probably wouldnt. Though weirdly enough i can feel sadness and cry when reading or watching sad movies. would taking anti depressants allow me to feel things again or would it numb my emotions even more?",1
"Does anyone struggle with depression and social anxiety and never having dated anyone? I’m a 21 yr old college student who has never done anything sexual and I’m not waiting for marriage or anything I just don’t put myself out there. And having depression doesn’t help.

"It's getting worse every year, I have been suffering from severe depression over 9 years and it did get a little better but when I start to overthink a slightest thing someone mentions it skyrockets to the worst point. For example the main thing I tend to overthink now is if my gf is pregnant. She knows about my condition and tries to help me out but it just doesn't seem get any better, we didn't have sex for 2 months and she did get her period both of those times but my brain couldn't see the logic that she wasn't pregnant even if it is biologically impossible. Then we did have sex with protection, I didn't have an orgasm, we just stopped after a while, a day after that she got her period and then I thought okay everything is fine, but after maybe half a day I started overthinking again what if she actually is? Even though it's not possible in any way, I just keep tormenting myself with these ridiculous thoughts when everything is fine and nothing actually happened.
For example I started telling her about a future car I want to get and it has 2 doors not including the boot , she said that it is stupid because it doesn't have all 4, my brain immediately thought ""does she mean that because she might be pregnant?"", or she recently started to drink more water because it is healthy I understand that but you can guess what my brain had to say about that. How can I work on stopping these kind of thoughts, I already told her how bad this is and she again tries to assure me that it isn't like I think it is, deep inside me I know that it isn't but I just can't stop my brain from thinking this kind of bullshsit.",1

"I am SO tired of suffering , I am in massive pain every day. The massive depression/anxiety was triggered by antibiotics and since then I have also been dealing with chronic illness issues which have been really awful. I can't tell if it's situational depression causing anxiety, a chemical imbalance, or I believe a bit of both. I don't know if I could have bipolar being that I have heard an episode can be triggered from antibiotics or if it's just anxiety/depression. I want to try therapy, or psych meds and get treated with stigma around it and it just makes me feel more hopeless honestly from being discouraged. I get told to 'try harder' with my anxiety/depression which obviously hasn't worked since it's been years of this and it's getting so bad I get OVERWHELMING panic to even talk to people or to even leave the house. I honestly just feel even more isolated and depressed getting treated like a drug addict to seek psychological help and I feel like I can't even really do therapy because of my psychotic over-the-top family. I have been self harming recently and I just don't see a happy life if I can't stop these feelings.",1
"At the risk of sounding like a spoilt materialistic brat.. I've come to realize that one of my triggers are what used to motivate me.

These last few years have been hard for me emotionally. Yep, part of what brought me down was financial. Not because of covid... covid has actually helped me. Situation has been steadily improving.

I've come to realise that what used to motivate me is becoming a trigger.

Homes.

I've always wanted a place of my own. Part of it is because, even though I have a somewhat o-k home where my family loves me, I hate living \*with\* them. Let's put it this way - if you did one of those 'first word that comes to mind' game with me, if you said 'family', my reply would be 'burden'.

Anyway. Homes, and beautiful homes, used to motivate me.

For example, sometimes to decompress, I would go to Ikea to walk around, and I'd figure out what I'd like to have in my future home.

Now, it still helps a little bit, but after awhile, I'll just realise that I'll never be able to get what I want, I can literally feel my heart drop, and then my whole world turns dark, and I'll feel tears welling up.

Just now, there was an advertorial for a home that is totally 'my type' of home. The more I read about it, the more I watch the videos and see the photos, the sadder I become. That feeling of 'I'll never have this' comes up, my heart sinks, and I'll go into that spiral, and I'll start thinking about... what's the point of all this.. why bother.. etc..

I've become aware of this trigger for other things as well, but so far, I've had the strongest reaction when it comes to homes.

You know 'the bigger they come, the harder they fall'? Like, I'll get the appreciation, like wow, such a nice home, totally what I'd like to get, then after that burst of positivity, it'll fall down hard.

I clearly need help. How do you handle this?",1

"I genuinely don't feel like it takes much to make me happy. My own comfy and cozy place where I can make the rules and only have to be responsible for myself, my books, and a warm drink is all I need. But god, every step to get there is so hard, I wonder if it's worth it. I can't sleep for numerous reasons, can't focus on college, barely have any control of my surroundings. I don't want to live like this but I'm stuck for a few more years. I want to go to sleep and wake up in the perfect life or not wake up at all",1
"I was doing really good but everything has just been going down hill, and the worst thing is I can’t control any of it. I’m happy about it because last year I used to have a very dull mindset and everyday was a struggle I use to wake up wanting to die but I’ve changed that. I could cry myself to sleep and hope to not wake up and then be ok and ready for the day when I wake up as I constantly remind myself that today could/will be a better day (it’s very embarrassing because it’s just been getting worse and worse lol but I still have hope)
But lately I’ve had so many issues beyond my control that is taking a large toll on me. I’m really scared that I will spread my sadness so that’s one reason why I isolate myself and then there’s this part of me that does it because I don’t want people to miss me when I’m “gone”.
It’s like an instinct in my head I didn’t know I was doing it until I had just stopped and thought to myself. I don’t want to hurt anyone if I “go” so I try emotionally detach myself from everyone and everything. One of the big reason for my recent wave of this feling is that I don’t have anything to look forward to I feel behind in life and I’m struggling.(but I’m already working on that like trying to find a passion or figure out what the hell i wanna do in the future because I’m 16 rn)
Kinda like an avalanche I guess. I was just chilling one day and all this snow started falling on me out of nowhere and I’m like “what the hell is going on” and everytime I feel like I’ve dug out enough snow there’s just more and more and more and it feels never ending but I keep digging but I feel like a clown for still thinking that I will one day get rid of the snow",1

I can't find work, I've been unemployed now for 10 years, can't even get a desk job because its advanced to being in my damn hands too, just typing this up is going to hurt. worse still is that that isn't even the least of my health problems, sleep apnea/insomnia, nasal pollyps, oral thrush that I can't get rid of because of my dentures, swelling and pain in my hands and legs that even the specialist can't identify what is causing that, a stomach ulcer that almost killed me last year, low testoscerone that I take injections for bi-weekly, and I'm sure I'm forgetting others. not to mention false teeth that cause me to lisp, got them 13yrs or so back. when I was a kid my psycho mother left my dad and forced me, my brother and sister to join her for a year and among many other horrible things that should never be done to kids she never bought tooth paste for that whole time, I never recovered until a quack dentist said it was time to yank them, got some poorly made ones put in as an adult when I could finally afford it, and then found out a few years later that they never should've been pulled in the first place and could've been salvaged. My arthritis hurts all the time, and my other issues cause discomfort and embarrass me and I can't do a damn thing about any of them. As you might be able to guess, these health issues feed into the real problems that cause me to fall further into depression. I can't get work because no one will hire me and the health concerns stop me from being in any way useful which has caused me to just plummet into debt, my father has even more issues then me and I'm trying to help him out as best as I can by being there for him, making meals, doing the daily shopping, and keeping track of what he needs but I can't do it alone and my brother and sister couldn't give a shit less. the debt has caused me and my dad to go to them for financial help and it causes a fight every single time, resulting in them giving us just enough to get through the month but no further and no help with the bills despite my asshole brother living here too and working full time. I've applied for disability insurance but now the doctors forms cost $150 and I don't even have that much available, so I can't get the ball rolling on it either. can't go on welfare because they also require those same forms apparently, and neither are even a guarantee that they will help us when they do go through the process. I don't know what to do and I've completely given up on trying to find a way out because I can't cope anymore, this shits just weighing down my mind completely. I am not asking for financial help, just merely stating what is contributing to my current state of mind.
But it doesn't stop there either, I am un-datable, no woman on earth even looks at me with interest anymore. being unemployed I know is stopping me in my tracks as well, but mostly its because I walk around with a cane. I've been single for as long as I've been unemployed now, 10 years, and it is something that I can't stop thinking about. I've never felt so alone in my life, my relationships with my dad and friend Travis only do so much to fill the void of being completely alone. I haven't had sex in all that time either, which I only bring up to make the point that when I start in thinking about dating again that's where I force my mind to go as a kind of coping mechanism. I know that it is incredibly pathetic to think about only the sexual side of a relationship especially at my age right now, feels like being 17 again, but if I stop and think about how I'd give anything just to hold a woman in my arms again, a kiss, a date, a real lasting relationship, anything along those lines I start feeling like I want to kill myself because I know none of it will ever happen again. lately though that's what I have been thinking about a lot, the overall loneliness has crept back into my head, I'm picturing long conversations and kissing, and the feeling of having someone in ur life that you love, and I can't seem to stop myself. its completely idiotic, I know it can't happen so long as I'm unemployed and crippled, and there's no fixing those issues so I'm right back to suicide like a full on emo teenager (no offense to emo teenagers).
Arthritis has ruined my life and I can't cope with it anymore. there are other problems I face regularly, but these main issues; being an unemployable cripple, the debt that its causing, and being an undateable loser. When I was a kid my parents divorce really messed me up, it was all the trademark things you'd expect from a 9yrs old in that situation; it was my fault, I blamed myself, I acted out a lot. high school wasn't much better, made a few friends but ultimately I was still very unhappy as are most teenagers. for those first few years after high school I thought things were turning around but then I dated someone who I really shouldn't have been for a few years, then next thing I know it was arthritis and everything that came after. I have never been happy truly, things kept turning my life to shit, sometimes it was my fault other times it was someone else's, but it keeps happening like that. why should I believe that my life or the life of my dad will ever improve? it won't, I know that for an absolute certainty now, I know for a fact that things will never get better for us, what's the point?
See the thing is, I can't bring myself to kill myself because of 2 things, my father and Travis, and the fact that I have no idea what's waiting for me on the other side. I'm agnostic, I don't know what happens after we die and I can't trust the word of anyone on that score because everyone that is alive right now isn't dead so how can anyone know? I know it sounds like I'm kidding but that's how I see it, and truth be told it scares the shit outta me. I don't want to live, but I don't want to die either, even when I want to and right now I want to.
I'm going to apologize in advance if I don't respond to many comments, I have a hard time staying on this topic for a prolonged amount of time, but I will try to respond to as many as I can. I'd also like to apologize as I get the feeling that this was a more rambly rant that might not make much sense, I've never been very good at expressing things like this. I'm the rock of my family, I'm the guy that holds things together, but when I can't anymore it tends to just fall out of my face.",1
"One year later after the trauma and I can't stop thinking of revenge. I want to take my own life so bad but I want it to be peaceful . Every way is expensive or hard to get in the US to have a peaceful fast death in my sleep. To the ""friend"" that threw me under the bus and ruined one of my lifes passions forever fuck you and go to hell. I would want nothing more than to see them go down with me. These thoughts are here everyday. They wont stop and im mentally ruined for life. One day im going to snap I can feel it. This feeling I never had before to actually kill someone and myself it grows stronger.",1
"I have sacrificed so much, went through so much for people.. maybe my expectations are too high.. now I feel I'm just alone.. in this void with nothing but a cigarette in my hand.

I am sorry to everyone who has gone through much more than me, I know my issues aren't that grave..
Maybe stems from my hyper dependence and my mental strength but I just needed to shout it out.",1
"hi im 13 M and i dont know what to do because i feel so anxious and tired even when i have a ton of sleep (which hasnt been for a while), i just have a problem about my feelings i dont want to talk to my parents about it so they dont understand why i cant go to school which is because i dont feel motivated to do anything due to my depression and tbh at this point i just want to lock myself in my room and fall asleep",1
"I’m 26. I’m your pretty basic, run of the mill, white guy. It’s just me and my dog, who I love dearly. For three years I worked in professional sports to live out a dream. I traveled with teams, had playoff celebrations, the whole deal. I left that life. The travel was excruciating. I had to move every 8 months. Pay capped out at $12-15 an hour. I was unemployed and alone during the entire Covid peak. I got a job last June in sports. It’s more 9-5, different business segment. I’m in school for data science to transition to more pay in a year and a half. My life just feels empty. Now that I’m not moving every 8 months, it’s apparent how empty my life is. No friends. Family far away. And as much as I love my small family, I have no friends. Nobody texts or calls. I deal with an identity crisis daily. Why do I wear all this sports stuff? I don’t even watch sports anymore. Who am I? What do I do? I don’t know how to swim. I don’t know how to play pool. I can’t dance. I haven’t been on a date in 3 years. Dating apps destroy my confidence and make me lose all hope in human decency. Who am I? Every weekend I lay in bed. Depressed. I play lots of video games to jump into worlds and escape my own reality. There’s no thrills. My dog’s separation anxiety is a built in excuse to never leave my thin walled apartment. Why bother? I’m 5’9. I’ve always struggled with my weight. I’m not fat, but I’m not thin. I’ve had love handle problems since I was in high school. I routinely tie ropes around my stomach to hold it in. I hate my body. But I’m inconsistent. I start/stop/start/stop which leads to injury. I just had to sit out a month with a stress fracture scare. Why am I doing this? Deep down who the fuck am I? On the surface, I’m this hard-nosed, cynical, self-deprecating northerner. I go hard until I burn out. I’m burnt out. Who would I rather be? The opposite. I’d rather be just this completely yogic/meditative person. I want to be loose. I want to be comfortable in my body. I want to have fun. I want to wear more vibrant colors. I want to drop all the sports shit. There’s this yoga studio near me that does all these events where there’s tons of people. Why do I have to be this cynical beat up asshole as a defensive mechanism. And it’s not just a yoga thing. Or whatever. That’s just an example. It’s everything. I fucking hate myself. Days are moving. Time is passing. How many fucking days will be in bed? How many nights will I sleep in hoodies or tie ropes around my stomach due to discomfort? How many days of my dog’s life are passing without me living it with him? I’m fucking dying. Daily. Then tonight I watch this wrestling show. There’s these people who’re my age. Great shape, doing cool things with their bodies. Why the fuck didn’t I try this? Why is my life so plain? Is no one ever gonna care about me? I feel like being acknowledged by this big crowd is something that screams to me. Because my existence feels so worthless.
This is all circles and a rant. Idk the meaning or reason. Each day I do nothing. I know no one. My depression is so strong I can’t fucking move. I can’t fucking see the point. People keep fucking telling me to go out and do shit. Think it’s easy? Wear something nice? Think it’s easy to sit down with all these ropes tied around me to keep my stomach okay? I have to be stonefaced and strong for people. I don’t have much in life. 4 family members. I need to be a rock. Cold and unfeeling. I have to be a constant. Yet I feel fucking hollow. My life’s reaching a point where things once possible now aren’t. I feel fucking fat. I feel empty. I feel there’s no point in going on. Why can’t I transform and become a radically different thing? I don’t even know who I am or who I should be. Im fucking confused. I want to be something special. I don’t want to die as a blip that not a single person will remember or care about when I do die. Im too much of a coward to kill myself. Killing my self feels like the only way I’ll be remembered. My death would have to be shocking and sudden to impact anyone, and it’d only be negatively. The fuck is wrong with me? I see these beautiful people on my tv my age who did this. And here’s me. Average white guy who’s doing grad school and work and tired every day, not leaving bed every day, not feeling okay with myself and no like minded community. The fuck do i do. Nobody’s here for me genuinely. I’m all alone. I’m all alone. Sorry for the rant",1
"Isn't life just so much fun I sit here and just think about all the fucked up shit that has happened to me with a knife in my hand and a gun in the closet next to me and I just sit here smoking weed taking my antidepressants and just cutting myself hoping it will end just like waking up from a nightmare and hoping once u go back to sleep u won't go back in to that same nightmare people always telling me it will get better what else is there to get better about what my family that fucking abused me or what and fucking love life I fucking gave that shit up who am I supposed to thank for this shit God he never cared for me this is why I just want it to end and the funnest thing is I am 15 there some many people that say u have your whole life ahead of u what fucking life the only life I fucking see is the bottom of my antidepressants or the end of a joint fuck my life 

Please just let it end",1
"I feel kinda at peace with my feelings now, I feel like I can finally go. I tried so so hard to hang on but I can’t take this anymore. I’m gonna jump off the tallest bridge I can find on my 21st birthday.",1
"I’m feeling so low tonight. I feel like I could disappear and nobody would care. I’m invisible unless people need something from me. But sure, I’ll be here when you need me. Because that’s just who I am. And I hate it.",1
"I used to be kind and polite and sincere and forgiving. I used to have good intentions, and I used to actually care about people. I used to have a sense of what I believed to be right and wrong, moral and immoral, ethical and unethical. I used to want to make the world a better place, to better society, to bring joy and fulfillment to peoples’ lives. I used to know the difference between good and bad, and I used to want good things to happen, even if bad things happened along the way. My mind used to be orderly. I had motivation and dreams. 

Now I am manipulative. I care about myself, and only myself besides those who I already have a preexisting attachment to. I do not hesitate to take advantage of another’s weakness or vulnerability, and I pride myself on becoming more and more cunning with each passing incident. My intentions are selfish and greedy. I operate based nearly on fear of consequence(s) alone. I wear the mask and disguise of who I once was to leverage more power. My ethics do not exist anymore. I do not believe in ethics. Only in the principle that everything is subjective. I do not care about the world or the path it takes in the grand sense. I am in some ways a nihilist. I do not wish good on most others simply for the purpose of wishing it. In fact, I harbor intense hatred and disdain for many people and many things. I despise almost everything about myself passionately. Some of my grudges seem unbreakable. My emotions are chaotic. I (humble brag) happen to be abnormally intelligent, so as you can imagine, my brain is very capable of processing just how miserable I really am. I barely have motivation to get out of bed. I cannot see a future for myself no matter how hard I try. I am fearful, impatient, and cynical.",1
I told my parents about my suicidal thoughts and stuff but now I feel guilty. Im not allowed to sleep alone and my mom is quitting one of her jobs so she can have more time with me. She's going to tell my dad in the morning and she said he's going to be so sad. I've never felt more like a burden. Will I feel better about it or does it get better on the family? I feel so bad!,1
"My depression has made it so hard for me to clean and my house has become a sty. It's so hard for me to clean, it's like I'm wading through sludge just to get any form of cleaning done, or anything done really. 

I have OCD as well (and anxiety and a functional neurological disorder- FML). My OCD makes me feel like everything is permanently disgusting and ruined. Like no matter how much I clean something it will still be tainted.

It's so tiring having depression and contamination OCD combined. On one hand I live in filth because of the depression and on the other hand my mind can't handle the filth and I spiral out of control. This conflict in my mind makes it so hard to get started doing anything. I just want to sleep. Always sleep.",1

"I'm writing this as record of my state of mind as of 11/13/21
All the Hate, all the Anger, all the Saddness. Compressed into the size of a match head, Its the darkest shade of black to exist. It hangs in the bottom of my heart weighing it down into depths which I do not know exist. I can carry this weight in my heart alone, but while I do, my legs, my lungs and my body feels like it grasps for life awaiting my last gasp of breath, I can not share this weight with anyone as i do not want to contaminate their soul. If I set IT down, IT will grow not in weight but size. Suffocating everything else in my life. Afraid of what will happen if IT grows I will carry this burden, as I feel what awaits in IT, is Death himself. I know presence, Iv met him before and escaped in which I do not remember how, and maybe this is my fear, maybe I cannot escape him again. I am not ready to die, I do not want to die but which will come first? Death taking me by the arm? or a mind of life drained away? I am not one to write like this, but it came to me in a early night dream. Im not sure what scares me more why I got this dream now or why I wrote it down whatever the outcome I hope I take this burden with me and do not allow it to spread.

"For context, I am a 17 year old female who’s been struggling with depression since childhood. It recently started getting bad the past 3 years as my grades went from straight A’s to borderline failing all my classes. I know you don’t need a college degree to be successful but I can’t even see myself graduating high school. It started with math class where I was always the last one to understand the lesson and by the time I started to get the hang of it we were already on to the next subject. This very quickly turned into “why even try when I fail anyways” and I stopped paying attention altogether. Then from there I stopped doing my work in other classes and instead of just procrastinating homework I would ignore it completely and take the 0 in the grade book. Things got really bad earlier this year and when I got a therapist for the first time I ended up spending the last month of the school year in the mental hospital. My parents decided to enroll me in a learn at your own pace thing and I haven’t touched it at all. Just watching a 10 minute video feels like the most mentally draining thing I could possibly enforce on myself. I know if I don’t start my schoolwork soon then it won’t get done at all but I physically can’t bring myself to do it. I’m digging myself into a deeper hole every single day and I just don’t know what to do anymore. If anyone has been in a similar situation to mine and came out of it with tips to share, please do not hesitate. I will take anything I can get at this point. Thank you.",1
I'm having a hard time tonight and could use someone to talk to,1
"i’m looking at all the posts here and it’s giving me doubts as to if i actually have depression 

15m / homeschooled / infj-t

and yet depression is the only way i know how to describe it. since february i haven’t felt myself. gotten worse since school started, started getting panic attacks. outside of the attacks it felt/feels like a dark cloud is always in my mind, sometimes in the corner and sometimes just taking over entirely. eugh awful. not all enveloping as much now, but now i’m getting brainfog and i still feel like shit. grades are down, they’ve never been down, i entertained suicidal thoughts but without intent, my parents know something’s up but i’m not ready to talk with them so i haven’t been able to open up and ask for help. i made this account just so i could be active on mental health subreddits without my dad seeing on my main. but everything here seems so much worse, second thoughts and doubt. oh, i’m probably just acting like this for attention or ugh i’m so freaking lazy. that’s probably incomprehensible but rant over",1
"Hi, I have been diagnosed with GAD, actually I have suffered from anxiety all my life without knowing it but only realised it recently. It has caused lot of problems with my personality like coping with pressure, mostly buckling under it. Caused me to leave my college degree unfinished, leave my job abruptly etc. I had contemplated hurting myself after quitting my job, I sought psychiatric treatment then and somehow got better. Right now I experiencing high levels of anxiety after a panic attack. Those pressures and fears which I was unable to cope with earlier have reappeared. I sometimes think that these will become unbearable for me😭...

I can feel these are just thoughts, tricks my mind is playing etc but they also feel so real at times like it's my nature. I am seeking counselling right now, I will see my therapist again in a couple of days but in meantime I wanted to share my situation here and hope somebody relates or has any advice for me. Thanks for reading.",1
"Last time I felt like I wanted to end it, I never went through because I always believed that it was going to get better (when I get a car, when I turn 18, when im in college)

Now i’m feeling the same way I did but with a key difference, I don’t have any of that hope. I’m pursuing things that somewhat interest me, nothing that makes me feel happy but even if I follow through and have a career and a future, I wont have anyone to share any of it with. So i’m left wondering why try to build something for yourself just to prolong an empty life? I have no notion that it’ll get better, so why am I still going? So I don’t upset my parents?

I do have a therapist but I feel like I can’t tell him because i’m a little afraid of being like 5150d and losing the last good thing I have (autonomy)

Any thoughts/advice?",1
"Just kinda ranting here and seeing if anyone can relate?? I have this deep dark hole inside me that I try to fill every weekend to no avail. I spend every weekday looking forward to the weekend. I go out and dance and party and I love it and enjoy myself but I walk back alone at the end of every night in pain and feeling empty and lonely and wake up every Sunday with the same pain, the same deep dark depression and I don’t know how to escape this cycle. If anyone has any advice please let me know. Love you all.",1
"So my therapist said that we will stop sessions while we do anger management class. So I’m dealing with my depressive symptoms with no one to talk to essentially. I’m married to a homeless french guy who was abusive and even if they track him down to sign the papers, I know he won’t sign. I really want to move on though. I am finding comfort in being alone, however. I’m really scared to get involved again. There are a couple guys I like … but it’s like my therapist said during one session , “What is the objective?” And I never really thought about what the end game is. So anyway right now I am in between, and I think all I really want is to have someone chill to cuddle every night. It would make me forget. But I think I’d still be lonely because my depression is super pervasive. I was complaining about my job, and boom the universe granted me a new one that day. Should be happy, right? But instead I’m an anxious and depressed mess still. Always exhausted. There is no reason for me to feel melancholy, but I still do. I don’t want to up my Zoloft, also. But maybe I should. Idk. I’ll talk to the psychiatrist. Anything in the meantime that helps depression?",1
"That lingering depression, constant mood swings, and the casual disinterest for EVERYTHING.

Honestly, the main thing that breaks my heart is that my sex drive is basically non-existent when I’m like this. It’s heart breaking to me, because I’m a pretty active person-sexually. Even more heartbreaking when I have to tell my boyfriend to stop touching me, because he loves to love on me. 



I want to scream, but simply remain silent. I want to cry, but can’t even shed a tear. I want to feel happy, but there’s no way to break from this feeling.

I thought that sleeping always make me feel better, but recently, I’ve just been waking up even more depressed than I was the night before. 


I FUCKING HATE THIS SHIT. Why won’t it EVER STOP?! 

Might just end up crying from being so frustrated at myself...

..I hate myself",1

I hung out with 2 friends I went to community college with we barely see each other now it started off okay after awhile I got over being around them like I guess they kinda got comfortable and became looser I was getting annoyed by them bc they were way more immature than they had ever been before n I was just over it and I found myself disliking them and being around them because of it and I may sound like an asshole but it kinda ruined my view of them completely and of my time with them at community college. More and more I find myself disliking ppl these days for one reason or another idk I just get annoyed by and sick of ppl,1

I had friends, went to school, played video games, etc. Fast forward to now when I’m 19 and I find it hard to even smile some days. I just get really fuckin pissed because idk why I feel like this. I have a loving and supportive family, any and everything I could ever ask for and for some odd reason I’m just in a bad mood for most of my days. It doesn’t help that I feel guilty for feeling like this because ik there are people out there that have it way worse than me and actually have a reason to be sad. Anyways, I’m just kinda high rn lol and been stressin for a few months now about this stuff; just wondering if any of u guys have felt the same before. Thx 🤙🏾",1
All I’m good at is my job and i hate working a job. I get girls that want me but then i feel like I’m to good for them.

"How can you live knowing the person you absolutely love will never love you the same way? I knew that it was probably not a good idea to get close to her but there was nothing I could do to stop it. There was nothing I could do to prevent myself from falling in love with her. Falling for her made me actually understand what love feels like. I love her and she's said the same for me, yet deep down I know that it's not real for her. Long story short she basically just uses me. Despite that, I love her. I'd do anything for her and I even know that she'll never love me the same. It kills me that this happened and that we won't ever be totally together. I know that I should get away from her, but there's nothing I can do. I can't help but always still be there. At this point I almost hope she ends things and finds someone she can truly love and be happy. I know I love her because despite all of this I can't be mad at her, I just care deeply for her. It just bleeds any life out of my soul that's left.",1
"Everything is going good in my life but I still have this empty feeling in my chest. I get paid 6 figures. I can live comfortably and buy what I need. I’ve met my personal body goals. I want a genuine connection with someone but that is so hard to find. I want someone to like me for who I am and not my money or my looks. It seems like that’s too much to ask. 

I grew up an ugly kid and no one really wanted to talk to me so I worked on my personality a lot. I started working out too and became less insecure. I noticed I started getting a lot of attention. It’s nice but I always think they only like me for my looks. I feel that way with my money too. Girls just seem to be interested in my car or clothes. Like do they really like me or my money. I don’t know I just feel like no one is really genuine to me. Everyone wants something from me. I feel lonely. This isn’t my main and on my main I’ve tried meeting people without showing myself. They all act different and more interested once we add each other on social media. I’m just tired of this feeling. Am I overreacting?",1
"I (25F) had a pretty rough start in life. I grew up in an abusive environment and had a lot of repressed trauma. I never really fit in anywhere and was usually the annoying girl that nobody liked. I just accepted it though and let people treat me any kind of way because I needed to feel a sense of belonging even if I was the butt of the joke in most cases.

I’m college it was pretty much the same. I just couldn’t seem to get things right and never made any real friends. Eventually, I just cut all my friends off. I figured it would be better to be alone than to continue allowing people to treat me horribly.

But today I was looking through old pictures and got kinda sad. I miss my friends and also the old me. I use not care what other people thought. Even if people didn’t like me, I still put myself out there. I was so social and I enjoyed the good memories.

I just don’t know how I got to this point where I have no friends and can’t open up to people. I feel so alone.",1
"I have no friend, going probably going to fail school again I wish I can end it right here. I see no purpose in my life don't know what I want to do, I lose motivation so fast it. I wish I had someone that would be next to me.",1

I used to have a job 2 year ago before lockdown and now I'm struggling to find a job since then, I even tried to setup an online business but it turned out to be a disaster, my girlfriend's left and are now getting married, my neighbour, cousins, friends are too getting married/minting money looking at that my mom is building constant pressure which indeed is affecting her mental health also... There's no income and we are just getting poorer day by day... I feel like there's no meaning in life left... I'm struggling to make a proper livelihood... I'm just pissed off of this life... I will not be editing the above statement I'm too tired to do so pardon my grammatical mistakes, please do comment I will feel better",1
"I see so many posts about people being depressed because they don't have this or that, and I am just an ungrateful piece of shit that has so much and all I can think about is my own death. 

I wish I could end myself and be able to give everything I have to someone who needs it.",1
"I told my friend how hurt I feel because my family treats me like an outsider, and he literally answered, “how come I couldn’t see your IG story from my second account yesterday?“ like wow. Anyway I was confused too because I had an unknown login attempt some days ago so I changed pw and mail address and asked him to check if he sees it now, and he literally left me on read, not giving the slightest fuck about what I initially wrote him. Every time I tell people about my feelings they end up not giving a fuck so why do I still do it",1
"It really frustrates me.

I have trouble sleeping, my biological clock doesn't exist. I know that this is a problem to me and yet it's already 6AM in the morning and Im just going back to sleep",1

That's literally it.

Thanks.",1
"All I fucking do in my spare time is sleep. I’m so sick of it, and yet I do it anyway. I get off from working my minimum wage shit job and then just… sleep. 

I’m so sick of this lifestyle. 

I have a boyfriend (how the fuck has he not left me yet?) and I want to be the best for him, and yet I continue with these shitty life choices. I’ve had an entire year to improve myself. All I’ve accomplished in this year is saving up money from working. And again, it isn’t that much. 
I’m terrified to go for a higher paying job and terrified to try anything new to improve myself. I feel so suicidal. I just want something to change in my life, I just want to be better. I have no fucking clue where to start. 

There are the simplest life skills I don’t even have… Jesus I am fucking pathetic.",1
My life is pretty much over. I’m 28 and a loser. Everyday is the same thing. My life is so bad that being at work is more fun than being at home. My parents are total losers and weirdos also so it’s nice to be brought into the world to just get completely shit on.,1
"my depression is starting to return, for months late last year into april of this year i was severely depressed. suicide attempts by noose, addicted to smoking weed, vaping, drinking, pills. but for months over summer i felt better than ever. now, i entered sophomore year in highschool and my grades started dropping, i started lacking motivation for my favorite hobbies. i started just zoning out in school, unable to even grasp the idea of paying attention. i started cutting recently and i feel like it relieves the pain, the stress, anxiety. my 2 other friends who have done it before started to talking to me about it, and i wish i never told them. they’re talking to me like a therapist, like someone who’s never done it before. yet they have. they’re coming off as someone who i can’t relate to, knowing i very well can. it just fuels my drive for suicide even more. i feel like a burden to everyone around me.",1
"Not only do I so vigorously refuse to contribute to society. I have an overwhelming urge to actively hurt it by intentionally having the least paying job I can and leech off of welfare. But obviously these efforts to inflict damage aren’t enough, I’d have to persuade others to take up this route as well as to promote anti intellectual movements across the country.

I tried my absolute best in college. I went from studying 30-40 hours per week for engineering and absolutely bombed my exams anyways despite my best efforts and despite utilizing all of the resources available to me (tutoring, etc). I then changed majors to film studies and found it only slightly easier (still failing courses), and with no end in sight and a fledgling GPA. Clearly, it’s a lack of intelligence.

I’m not intelligent enough to do the things I want to do in life and it has utterly broken me. This damn society has put such a huge emphasis on education that without one in todays America, it’s hard to succeed in life. The US has been so saturated with bachelor’s that it’s nigh impossible to get comfortable office jobs without one. 

To make matters worse, I’ve been fired a couple of times from odd jobs for incompetence.

I’m utterly depressed and am aimless, even working out and taking medicine and being in shape have not helped. There’s a void in me that can’t be filled and I’m already 24, but it seems like I won’t amount to anything and that the end is near for me.

I’ve dealt with an abusive mother, so I haven’t exactly had a stable home life.",1
"I will prob delete this later, just felt like ranting but yea, tw: abuse

I can’t show emotion at all
Every single time in my life I have tried to show emotions, I always immediately got/get shut down. I used to cry when I got hurt, and you know what people said to me? Man up, man up, man up, man up I fucking hate it so much I get triggered by just remembering it. I feel ashamed to even look sad in front of people, I will literally run as fast as I can away from someone just so my emotions won’t come out in front of them, no matter the pain. at this point I don’t think I could physically even cry in front of someone... my grandma and her anger, she would take it out on me a lot.. pretty much until I turned 9-10 and got too strong, if I did anything remotely considered “bad” even so much as cursing she would hit me.. hard.. either In the face with her hand, or legs with a leather belt. I remember so vividly, what she would do all the time is: she would take away all my stuff, then make me wait in silence and suspense for a while, then she would unexpectedly come in and start to hit me, I would cry out of fear just by seeing her, and she would yell, and yell saying things like: “I’ll give you a reason to cry!” She would hit me a lot then leave me to cry in pain once she was calmed and I was beat. she never even tried just talking to me. ever.. I remember another thing she she did was, she would make me walk in closed spaces past her then she would immediately hit me, hard in the back of the head the second I passed her, I still flinch whenever walking past someone In a closed space even if they aren’t mad at me. She would also humiliate me and make me look like an idiot in front of others a lot for showing my emotions. why is Why does she take it out on me so much, what did I do wrong? Why does she hate me? Why did she humiliate me for showing emotions? I don’t want to be hit, it never helped anything, I just want to talk I’m not violent I’m the slightest, I listen. why couldn’t she just talk with me? I can’t even except physical touch at all anymore, it’s an immediate trigger and I’ll immediately decline it. I hate the touch of others because of her, she used to have the audacity to try and hug me, while saying bullshit like: “nothing is wrong.” I hate her so much she’s so, so horrible. And so many others too doing the same bullshit with: “man up”, “calm down”, “your wrong.” Fuck off, why can’t people just leave me be.

Sorry that this is super long, just got a lot to say.",1
"I can't keep seeing her story anymore. I've realised we can't go back to the same friendship we had, despite she trying I can't help myself but feel down everytime I see her with someone else. I don't know what to do at this point. Though the situations improved a bit as I am getting over her. But everytime I see a post or story of her with someone else, I partially feel happy and mostly feel sad, reminding me why I couldn't be with her. I am not even confident about myself anymore. That self confidence that I had built for past 3 years, gone down in pieces, well that's just a dramatic way of saying it. Or life just showed me the reality, it is what it is. Just venting",1
"I have been dealing with lack of motivation that has slowly grown over the past couple years

I recently have become emotionally numb (few days ago) and lack much joy in doing anything. I feel like I'm living someone else's life as my memories don't even feel like my own anymore. Stuck in this dull state I don't even feel like living anymore. Things I used to enjoy seem pointless. I feel as if I'm falling down a black void. 

I am envious of my younger self that enjoyed things and was content with life. I long for the days when I didn't have to worry about current world events and the world made sense.

I feel beside myself. Dissociation seems to be what I'm experiencing.

Is this normal for depression? Does it ever get better?",1
"I still struggle with the fact that I don’t like myself . As a person or in the way I look I have always felt inadequate. I can’t let go of the bullying I experienced in middle school, or in my family life, although it’s been about a decade. I was always picked on for being ugly or overweight at school, and I had a grandmother (when I was about 9 or 10) that really drove it home and told me I was ugly and fat and wasn’t gonna amount to much. I feel like everyone looks at me like this. It affects me still. I hate myself and what I’ve let myself become . How do I let this past go ? How do I feel beautiful again ? I can’t even get myself to put on a dress or lingerie for my boyfriend. I always wear masks at work because I like that it covers my face from the world. I just want to get over this so I can stop crying about it to my boyfriend . Thank you for reading ❤️",1
"I'm perpetually low but sometimes going through the comments makes me feel if everyone was this considerate, maybe I'd be in a better place",1
"I can't explain why I feel this way. Everyday now, I want to break down, cry, scream the top of my lungs out then the opposite I feel like I am an empty shell. Living but, not really living. I'm tired of the therapy and medication. I just want to be okay, feel be happy without those things. It ends up being expensive and exhausting... I also feel, alone. My best friend lives in Japan now. Everyone else around me, that are my ""friends"" I don't feel they are. They only want to be with me when I'm at my best. When I am at my worst and want to talk... well... they ignore me. Tell me to get over it. That my life isn't as bad as other people. The other day I wanted to hang out with a friend, to get my mind off things. They agreed. When the day came and I went to their town which is almost 30 minutes away from me, I messaged them saying ""are we still hanging out? I've been waiting around for 3 hours in a town I don't know very well. If we aren't I would like to know, otherwise I'm going home at 9pm"" (it was about 8pm when I sent the message) They read it straight away and told me that my message I sent was ""entrapment language"". A person I had known for awhile telling me that I'm entrapping them? obviously made me extremely upset. So I went home. I started to wonder... is that what people think? I'm entrapping them? Forcing them to hang out with me when they don't want to? Am I a bad person? A bad friend? All I wanted was to hang out with someone I consider close to me to get my mind off things... if they didn't want to they didn't have to say yes... I would of understood but.. makes me feel like I'm the bad one. Maybe I am. Should I even keep living if I am a bad person?",1
"i really dont know how long i can last. i do everything alone, i eat all my meals alone, i have no one to talk to. my b-day is coming up and i'll just be crying by myself",1
A few days ago I was bashed and robbed on the train. I'm trying to move on from it but the situation keeps replaying in my head. I can't even sleep because I'm thinking about it too much. When will this torture end.,1
I don't see a future. I'm not sure what is next.,1
"Ever since I was young, death was on my mind a lot. I would think about what would happen to me if my parents just died, imagining just waking up one day to find that sleep had turned to death. Being threatened with a double suicide for not being good enough on the violin. Fantasizing about sacrificing myself in order to die a meaningful death. Once I became an adult, these thoughts faded, but the idea of dying has become so normal, I'm no longer really afraid of it. The pain I'm afraid of, certainly; I imagine the body would naturally be afraid and struggle out of instinct. But death itself seems to be such a natural thing, and in a sense comforting, as it means no longer having to struggle to survive or even just to be happy.

The last few years have been kind of rough. I've had my fair share of heartbreaks, but my sensitive disposition makes it difficult to close old wounds, which makes it more and more difficult to continue over time. Thanks to a combination of friends, therapy and a general stubbornness to see if there's more that life can offer, I've managed to just about survive. But when times are difficult, sometimes I walk out to a dark bridge at night, place a knife to my wrist or just imagine putting a gun to my head. These glimpses into the void are strangely comforting, almost rational. When it's a struggle to even feel, much less be happy, the idea of just dying seems like a simple solution to a long-term problem.

But just because I have trouble being happy, doesn't mean others do. While I'm here, waiting for my turn to pass, I intend to help others live happy lives in the hopes they never have to share my experiences. I rather doubt I'll ever truly feel lasting joy and happiness again, but there are many other lives out there that don't need to be like mine.",1
"I feel guilty for having depression without having any sad backstory or reason my life is ""fine""",1
"I keep getting these intrusive thoughts in my head, been having them since I was around 8 or so, about how I really would be happier as a woman. Whenever I managed to lucid dream, the very first thing I'd try to do was turn myself into one.

Occasionally I appreciate being a man but it's only for purely utilitarian reasons. And even that doesn't really hold up; practically every aspect of my life would've been better had I been a woman.

It just makes me so sad thinking about how by some cruel twist of fate I had to be a man. This really sucks.",1
"One of my friend's birthday is coming up next week, and he said that he wanted to make it big and special with the rest of our group, with a day dedicated solely to his birthday. He expressed that we should all make it really special for him because it's Thanksgiving break. I told him I had plans with my girlfriend that day, but I was totally on-board with doing it in the following days. A couple hours ago my girlfriend said she wanted to cancel our plans to instead do the group hangout on his birthday, without warning or any real though towards my feelings (at least from my POV). She said it's because it's his special 18th.

I turned 18 over the summer, and while a few of my friends wished me a happy birthday, I ended up hanging out with my parents that day. Everyone always said my 18th would be awesome, but I just felt like a sort of afterthought. I did enjoy spending the day with my parents though, and I'll always cherish that. All of the days surrounding my birthday our group *did* hang out but there was never a mention of my birthday. I've tried to be more of a stoic, and a less materialistic, self-centered person in the past couple years, so I stopped thinking about the whole situation.

Here we are today though, and I'm really sad, and no one around me seems to care.

For for my friends birthday next week, he wants me to get him a nice gift, and my girlfriend is thinking of getting him an expensive, beautiful teapot (he's a barista). For my birthday, he didn't get me anything and she gave me a small bracelet. While I love the bracelet so much, it starts to hurt when neither reciprocate a similar level of gift-giving. Like I said earlier, material possessions aren't very important to me, but it starts to hurt, man.

My girlfriend saying *his* 18th was special in a way told me that mine wasn't meaningful at all, and her and I's plans for next week (of which we had had for weeks) were pretty meaningless. I feel like I care so much about people's birthdays, and all I get back is some second-thought gifts and a total ""ignorance"" towards mine. My friends never care for anything that *I* want to do on *my* birthday, but with the expectation that I dedicate all my life towards them on the days surrounding theirs.

If one's 18th birthday is so special, why was mine a total afterthought? Summer is more of a break than Thanksgiving break, and if breaks define birthday importance, why was mine brushed off? Why does my girlfriend and other friends give me less thought-out gifts, but give others meticulous and expensive gifts? This all hurts so much, and I feel awful right now to be honest.",1
"Every morning when I wake up, I always ask why? What’s the purpose if I am just going to feel helpless and hopeless again. “Help yourself” they said but how? 
Been taking my meds for more than 6 months but I still feel the same. I just want to be stoic. I want to be a robot with no emotions. 

I will be happy to not wake up the next day. I want to leave this world in a peaceful way....",1
"I wish there was someone to blame. But really it's nobody's fault. Everything's just fucked up and that's just the natural state of things...I just wish I didn't mind becoming nothing, I'm so tired of living...of ppl.

"I stop laughing and realize in a couple hours life is going to be shit again. 

I don’t deserve to have fun because I’m not doing my responsibilities.

I look forward to going out with my friends then when I’m out with them. I don’t have fun because I know I’ve had a shitty week. I made the shitty week it’s my mentality.",1
"I'm a waitress and every Saturday I work 10 am - 8 or 9 pm. This morning 10-4 I made over $150 in tips. Then I lost it while putting it in my pocket as I left work and no one could find it. My coworkers searched everywhere, even the whole parking lot. My mom helped me search my car. And there's nothing my job can do about it either. So I worked my ASS off ALONE from 10-4 for quite literally nothing. 

The bulk of my weekly pay comes from Saturdays and I'm not well off financially. (Grew up close to poverty so money is a big deal to me) and now I'm devastated. I know it's not the end of the world but I'm angry at myself for being so stupid and never doing anything right, even the simple things like not losing my money. I'm so unhappy with my life and I give up EVERY Fridays &amp; Saturday to work so the only thing I ever look forward to is making decent money. 

I had a panic attack about it so bad that my mom had to drive me home the rest of the way. I'm going to be beating myself up over this for a long time.",1
"I don't know what to do my depression and anxiety has gotten so bad that i can't have a clear mind anymore so when I wake up all these thoughts race my head and I get dizzy and nauseous so basically haven't gone to school once since Nov 1 but i didn't do so good in October either, when I'm not at school I feel anxious when I am at school I feel anxious and depressed, i don't now what to do",1
i just feel sad but i can’t pinpoint what exactly is making me sad and soon i’ll forgot i was ever sad to begin with so was the sad ever there?,1
"I've really felt like a failure this semester. It makes me sad thinking back to elementary school when I was a happy gifted kid with so much potential. Now I'm a socially anxious depressed loner and my grades are absolute shit. I don't care about myself or my future anymore, I've been too tired to even speak lately and my parents try so hard to help me but they just don't understand. It's sad. I don't feel like their daughter anymore, I'm just a person taking up space in their home. They are good people, they deserve a better child. I'm so fucking scared of growing up.",1
"Nothing feels worth it anymore. It's like, what's the point?
Why are people going about the day when life is all just pointless?",1
"I have been hitting a wall lately. 
I suffer from depression on &amp; off. I think I'm always a little depressed but sometimes I'm coping better than other times. I don't know.
Either way recently work has been really stressful and family has been really stressful at the same time. It's causing me to spiral. 

Well I made the mistake of calling my mom to ask her for some work advice (she's in the same feild) and I instantly regretted it as she started using a clipped tone of voice and lecturing me about how she's tired. 
After I hung up I had to detox from the conversation and I tried working out and having a shower. She calls back and lectures me again about professionalism (random). The call ended in a huff and now I find myself just drained and empty. 
I'm dreading my bf calling tonight because I know I'll be a drag to talk to and I don't have the energy lately to act normal around him. 

I'm overall just super unhappy. I think I could sit in my closet and let days pass me by and not care at all. 
The only thing bringing me any happiness at all lately is my pet. 

I'm worried this depression episode will affect t my performance and interactions at work as it already kind of has been.",1
"Why? Why after so many years of fighting until exhaustion, when we are finally free and are able to go back to living instead of surviving.... it starts all again.

 Why keep fighting if a relapse ends up ruining all my previous effort?

Only you understand the pain, the suffering, the crying for many hours straight many times a day, sometimes everyday.

How not to loose hope? How have you won the battle against a full relapse? How can it be possible?",1
"Lately I can't force myself to get out of bed when my alarm goes off UNLESS I have to go to work. So on the weekdays when I work I can get up but on the weekends I oversleep. Does anyone have ideas for an obligation I can have on the weekend, that I HAVE to do?",1
"when i was a teenager, i thought my depression was just a phase like how everyone said online. i could just snap out of it when i grow up.

now i am a young adult, my depression is still there. it doesn't go at all like how teenage me thought it would be. i finally understand why people use alcohol and drug to sedate themselves. the running thoughts of disappear and unalive are too much sometimes. 

i was diagnosed with mental illness and i can never be cured. i can never have the healthy mind like a normal person. living with this twisted brain is torturing.",1
"Because I never felt like a real person growing up. Still don't feel real most of the time.

Especially when the dissociation is bad, but even in general, both socializing and when alone..

Death makes more sense as it matches up with how I feel, non-existent. Life is just a sad and often frightening dream, death would be closer to how I feel in life.

To become death, the pure abstraction, just makes more sense.",1
"Last few weeks were the worst of my life. I thought it was hard enough before, with my 7 years of depression and pain. After I left university because of my depression, i never really recovered. Since then I have therapy, switched therapist now and then. Hope was the worst, it was the reason why I didn't give up my life, but it was all a lie to me. It never worked out it just got worse. I had a relationship for the last 2 years with a girl, that understood me to a certain degree, because she had a hard life too. We helped each other. I had hope again. I was smart had ""potential"" . All wasted imo in a unworthy being. Antidepressants had side effects that almost certainly would have made me insane. 

A few weeks ago, I was already struggling with my psyche, my grandfather died. It was hard but I was already numb from my everyday sadness and pain. After that i visited my other grandfather in his dying bed. He's still alive but he isn't really here. He does't want to be anymore, he had enough. My family has a really hard time right now. They all feel very bad. 

At the same time at the girlfriend front I had already build up hope, that we will move together, when she told me, that she will end the relationship, if I get the covid vaccine. Emotional blackmailing at it's finest. Her religion and beliefs are the foundation for that reasoning. I realised if I want to stick to what I think is right, she will leave me, if I wanna stay with her, I need to give up the rest of my will, it would not be worth it, to give up myself(?)

Meanwhile I don't have enough work to pay my rent, everyday I hate my job more, but they dont give my more than 1-2 two days a week, so trading hate for existential fear. My family has to support me financially and in normal dutys. My savings come to an end. I've got more and more bills, that I can't pay. But I don't wanna ask my family anymore. They did too much for me for nothing. I don't wanna be their burden anymore. 

Haven't seen my therapist in a while, he doesn't know about the past weeks, my healthcare insurance had to reevaluate my case, so they interrupt payment for a few weeks. 

Oh and another good part is, I'm now in quarantine, because I have covid 19. Alone in my pathetic room while being sick and sad. 

Now it feels like I have no past, no present and no future. I think about suicide for over 10 years. I had a vision few years back, that at age 27 I will do it. February 2021 I turned 27, but didn't wanna die anymore. I wanted to live my life. I was happy, that it didn't come true. But the universe seems to force it. It shows me every day more reason to end this. End this pathetic life. It would mean so much to me. But how could I induce pain to others? It would hurt my family so much. I don't wanna hurt them. They are already in alot of pain. They lost beloved ones just a few weeks ago. 

I tried to use what I learned from life and therapy. Use my thought's and feelings in a positive way. Now life takes away more and more reason to stay positive. I didn't even have time to miss my grandpa, I had no chance to think about it, because of all the other things that kept happening. 

I feel it coming... but it will be much uglier than I imagined",1
no matter what it is. nobody fucking cares . it’s really getting to me now. i just wish i was someone’s number one priority. i just wish someone would fucking care . i wish someone would see me,1
"So I'm 17 and i just needed to get this off my chest, my depression and my anxiety, and my agoraphobia is ruining my life. My doctor put me on effexor because my mother is on effexor and it works for her i guess. But i am so sick of just everything. Everyday in on the verge of a breakdown and i just want to crawl into a pit and gradually dissipate into nothingness. I find no solace in anyone or anything. My parents feel as though they have put up with me, and I'm sick of my existence. I smoke weed everyday to help combat my anxiety and depression I'm just going to go to my doctor and ask for stronger medication before i crack. I have no friends, i have no work relationships because i can't even leave my house to find a job. I haven't completed my education because my depression got worse over the lockdown and i was barely able to even wake myself up, i feel as though i have so many years left to live but i don't want to live them, I've tried cutting once but i decided that that shit hurt to much so I've just decided to wait for my natural death to come. I jog late at night so i can get mugged or something, i want this shit to end i hate that i have to take each day, day by day. I feel like a disgrace in everything i do.

I keep busy, but everything I do feels like a bandaid for something that really needs urgent care. Things that were once fun to me, I see only as things that buoy me from continuing to sink. I've never really told anyone my struggles and the only person that really knows is gone from my life now. People only see/saw that I was this person's ""rock"", that I was the one helping them stay alive. No one knows, I don't think this person even did, that they were helping keep me alive as well.

I just feel like the worst person in the world I can’t even make any friends. Ever since I moved here 2 years ago my life has been a mess. I lost a lot of my friends from my old home and I can’t even make any here it’s so embarrassing. Literally nobody likes me I swear. I got in touch with my crush temporarily about a year ago and we said how much we missed eachother and I told her about my depression. We never talked much before I moved but she was really supportive about it and I really appreciated it. But then after like a day or 2 she started become distant and eventually in febuary I was blocked out of nowhere. A month later a mutual friend told me her overprotective bf didn’t want her talking to me. I literally never talked about anything other than school and hobbies in case of something like this but that clearly didn’t matter. Then the mutual friend stopped talking to me soon after she told me that and it just hurts. Not only can’t I make friends but I just lose the ones I’ve made. And it’s not only those 2 I just feel like the few other friends I have show little to no interest anymore. I literally can’t understand why I have to suck do much to be this unlikeable but maybe I’m just that dumb. This is do embarrassing but I don’t know what else to do.,1

"Everyone will find a way to forgive me for what I am. I just hope it's not too late. I should have ended my life a long time ago. But selfishness is a human quality. So here I am. Allowing other people to hurt because I'm a coward. I know this doesn't make sense. This is just a place for me to write it down. I know this won't be seen or found. I think the biggest lie I've ever been told is that it will get better. Because no one mentions how time changes a person. No one mentions that sometimes this feeling is just what you are and no amount of waiting it out will make it better. I don't know why I'm wasting my time here. I always want things to be different. I always want to be ""better"". But I never will be. I've prayed and hoped and cried and realized the same things I've realized 20 years ago. This is just what I am and what I'm destined to be. Miserable. Alone. Forgotten. It always comes back to that. And I always laugh. I laugh that I was dumb enough to believe it could ever be something different. All I have left is to laugh at myself. Laugh at the prayers and the hopes and the selfishness. Laugh at the idea that there's a god that would listen to me. As if I deserved it or as if I wouldn't be dismissed for everything I am and that I've done. I laugh that I get lost in hope long enough to pretend I didn't make a mistake by getting married. I laugh that despite these conversations with myself, I was selfish enough to take everyone down with me. I laugh because the only thing I can live for is some sick joke I play on myself over and over again. I'll die somehow. And everyone will forget. I'll be a regret and that will be my legacy. Or lack thereof. Just a burden for people to realize they were happier without me. But hey, at least I've always known right? I can be thankful for that. I'll always have that. It always comes back to that.",1
"I’m 20years old, living my parents &amp; three brothers, and have been out of high school for a solid two years, almost completely unaware of how damaging my high school experience was to me despite it being very much mundane experience.

I was very much aware of the fact that I was DEPRESSED during school but I didn’t think I straight up had or was coming down with depression. I just thought I was reflecting the general emotions of many of my peers who had or were developing depression, as I been known to do. Even when I asked my doctor about it, I was simply diagnosed with mainly Anxiety and “Other Depressions.”(Don’t know what that was supposed to mean…)

For the longest time I had genuinely hoped that once I graduated and was out of a school filled with mildly “depressed” students, that my mood/emotional state would gradually get better, and i think it did for short period of time…then the quarantine happened.

At first i didn’t feel too bad about it, I was more of a homebody anyway, plus my dad has his cannabis business to which he has two workshops literally in front of house, so work and income was not that big an issue. But after a while I began to feel…dull. I found it incredibly difficult to literally any of the things I enjoy: drawing/painting, playing video games, hanging out with my brothers, etc. Most of my days were just me going to work then spending the rest of my day in bed scrolling through my phone. It was safe to say that I was in denial of the fact that I had depression. It wasn’t until I told my friend Olivia, who is way more psychologically intelligent than I possibly will ever be, about how I was feeling to which she responded by straight up telling me I had depression, only then did I begin to accept the fact that I may have depression.

I wish I could say things got better after accepting my possible depression but it didn’t, quite the opposite actually. I didn’t know what to do with this information. The obvious option was to get therapy, but there was no way for me to do that without my parents help, and though I should tell them about this, my relationship with my dad has on ice ever since I came out as gay in during junior year (he’s super religious)and even before that he’s always been one of those “mental illness doesn’t exist,” type of people or claiming that mental illness is a “white people thing,”(we’re a black family), the only reason he hadn’t kicked me out is because I’m still his son. My mom on the other hand, does accept me but still sides with my dad when it comes to me dressing in gay/pride theme clothing claiming that I’m “advertising.”
(I know she’s just worried about me being the victim of a hate-crime but still…)
I don’t think she’s as dismissive of mental illness compared to my dad, but I also don’t think she takes me completely seriously when I tell her somethings wrong with me.

In short, i’ve been keeping it all to myself and that’s been my norm up until these last two weeks. Me, Olivia, and our friend Kamar, had been working on our group costumes for Halloween, to which we spent a-lot of money on but couldn’t finish in time, which bummed me out greatly because I was the most excited for Halloween this year it was gonna be my first time dressing up again since Middle School, but It ended up being a wasted effort and because of it I ended up missing my monthly credit card payment because didn’t have enough money in my bank to cut it.

What follows, is my dad getting mad at both me and my mom for not being able to manage cannabis plants that have practically grown twice our size then an argument between my parents causing me to straight up run out of the workshop and to my room where I had a little emotional breakdown/tantrum. Afterwards, dad finally hires some new workers four days ago and I’m left in charge with watering plants. I thought I was doing a good job until today when my dad had literally cussed me out over the phone because I forgot to water one room of plants that were like a week away from being completely grown, yet he made it seem like I deliberately chose to ignore those plants four days. He then proceeds to make a whole scene in front our entire household making me out to be a incompetent mooch saying how I’m a grown man and shouldn’t be lazing around and being forgetful, just completely disregarding all the UNPAID work I did do for him and demanding I give back the first paycheck he gave me in well over two years. Sorry I’m FUCKING HUMAN, things slip my mind from time to time. 

I know this is long, but I needed to vent….",1
"I literally can’t even watch tv, everything seems so hard to do. What do you guys do when you feel like this?.. I wish I could jsut get myself to sit through the office or something.",1
"I don’t even give a shit about life anymore. It’s harder and harder to go on with life when I can’t be myself. I’m a trans woman, and to say my family is unsupportive is an understatement. Go look at my post history for context, or don't, IDGAF. My mother gave me so much shit for crossdressing and being who I am to the point I was given an ultimatum to stop doing anything feminine she doesn’t approve of or get kicked to the kerb. I am also to do all the housework and respond to every fucking text, email, and other form of communication whether I am busy or not. I am also estranged from my extended family for personal reasons. In the time I’ve come out, I continue to put on weight and get emotionally abused by my mother on a near-daily basis, and I continue to hear my deadname and male pronouns and terms and it hurts so bad. I literally get so anxious and want to cry every single night when I go to bed at how hard it is to be trans without an accepting environment and no way to escape.

I can’t even land on my feet because I have close to $30K in debt I can’t pay off despite being a highly-paid software developer (for being 21, at least) because of how fucking expensive the cost of living is in my province and my mother incessantly asking me for money for her to blow on stupid shit she doesn't need. Then I get called a fucking hoarder for spending $20 on a stuffed penguin to help me with my anxiety at night.

I don’t have anyone in real life I can genuinely be honest about my life aside from my therapist and psychiatrist, much to the dismay of my aforementioned mother who claims their support is ‘not effective or acceptable’. In her own words, my therapist needs to tell me being trans will cause me so many problems to the point of getting arrested.

I don’t even feel like I’m living anymore. It just feels like I’m going through the motions because I have to. I’ve stopped posting on the trans subreddits because I just don’t have the willpower to write on Reddit, and it’s not like anyone would care about my depressing bullshit anyway. I honestly feel more alive when I get drunk and play video games on my days off. Though my job is way less stressful than my previous call center gig, it feels like I wasted an entire day after working 8 hours. I honestly only live to get drunk on my days off before noon.

The day I can finally land on my feet and go NC with my mother is the *only* thing keeping me going. I'd consider living in my car or a cheap-ass hotel if I wasn't needing WiFi for work just to have freedom.",1
At night and for some reason only at night I feel like im going crazy to many thoughts are going in and out of my brain to the point where I want to just die I can't find any answer's and I just don't know what to think,1
"I'm a little scared tonight. For a while my memory has been getting worse (mainly short term, but both) and even typing this I keep forgetting what I am trying to say, or what I was going to type. I also have to read each sentence back five times to make sure it makes any coherent sense. Also I read that sentence wrong while re-reading and was very confused. Tonight I was trying to enter my password for something and had to type it like three times, and then finally stop, and very slowly hit each key one by one. I have typed with both hands for years. They wouldn't move right. I'm just gonna blame it on the fact that I got 3 hours of sleep instead of 10 an apparently my brain says goodbye if it doesn't get 10+ (ideal is 12 not gonna lie) Also I had to interact with way to many humans today. Idk, I will see in the morning after I reset.",1
"I don't know how to be happy anymore. I have nothing to live for.

School is exhausting and so stressful. It takes up the majority of my week. I can't drop out because my parents would never let me.

My family frustrates me. I can't run away. It's too complicated and the police will get me.

I have friends, but no best friends. I'm nobody's #1. They always leave me.

I have a couple hobbies but it doesn't change anything.

I hate myself, I hate the way I look, I hate my personality, and I hate my life. I lie in bed all day with my laptop. 

I constantly imagine myself jumping off a building, dying and being obliterated.",1
"Man, you find the worst fucking communities in this place it's no wonder people feel so fucking alone.",1
It reminds me of how much lonely I am. I wish I had close friends like them. All they do is play games and travel to earn money. Meanwhile my 9-5 job is making me think that I am not even living life.,1
"Forgive me if this post is all over the place. My brain is not okay and I’m having trouble processing my thoughts :(

I’m 27 years old and was officially diagnosed with depression at 18 when I went to a psychologist. I’d say my depression really started when I was about 10 and I feel like I was just born with anxiety.

I was having on and off suicidal ideations starting at 13 years old. My psychiatrist has me on Zoloft, Wellbutrin, and Vyvanse (newly diagnosed ADHD). 

Anyways, when I met my now fiancée 3 years ago, things took a turn for the better. She’s absolutely amazing and is still such a big support when it comes to my mental health. For the first time in a long time, I felt like I was going to be okay. Whenever we’re together, everything *is* okay. 

I don’t know what exactly brought my depression back so violently but I’m pretty sure it’s my job. I have a decent job in telecom sales making about 55k a year. I know there are people out there that have no job or are getting paid shit and I feel awful complaining about my job because of it.
It just feels like I’m stuck. I have a bachelors in psychology but that doesn’t get you anywhere…. 
I don’t have any marketable skill… I tried learning how to code recently but my ADHD/ depression makes me lose interest and focus so quickly.

I’m diabetic and as of late I think I’ve been self sabotaging by purposefully eating sugar laden foods and not taking my insulin. I’ve been putting on a lot of weight and I’m not even enjoying the food I eat.

I don’t know why I’m posting this…. I just feel so fucked up in my own mind…. I hate this feeling.",1
"26 years old now and still I am waiting to live life like it was meant to be. But unfortunately it will never happen.

I am so tired of living like this. All I have is my mom, and she is 65 years old. I have nodad, no friends, no siblings, no relatives. She took all of that away from me.

I don't have any friends. It's not as if anyone wants to be my friend. The only ""friends"" I had were guys who wanted to see if there was a chance at being my boyfriend. They just used me. It was either boyfriend or nothing.

There is nothing to look forward to. I have nobody to talk to and look forward to. All I do is work and go home, and fantasize. I have a very unique perspective on life. I have never met anyone out there like me, and who thinks the way I do. I have been in love many times but have never been in a relationship, been kissed, and obviously never had sex. I just built fantasies in my head about women three times my age and wasted my life thinking about my fantasies.",1
"I just want out so bad, I want to escape. I'm working as an Amazon delivery driver right now and sometimes I deliver 2 packages to one house (I'm in SoCal so often a really nice house with Tesla's in the driveway) and ones for Mike Jones and the other for Sarah Jones- a married couple. And I just think, wow, how nice their lives must be. To be living with your partner in a house, money not an issue, both ordering things to meet their fancy on Amazon. 

Meanwhile my ambition is to afford a car I can comfortably sleep in so I can shower at the gym to avoid paying rent, and play video games at a Starbucks. To get a girl would be a dream but girls want abundance, and I simply can not provide. I see people making millions on wallstreetbets and I don't know how to feel, cause all I have ever done is lost money on the stock market. Everything is money. If someone says money cant buy happiness just walk a mile in my shoes, or maybe the 2 miles I walk to the bus stop to get to work.",1
"The title pretty much sums it up. I’ve been working since I was 15, maybe took a year off sometime in college. Anyways fast forward to today, I make $32/h as a loan processor. I honestly landed in the position cause my previous employer needed processors BUT no one lower would take the position so they jumped 2 tiers down and asked me if I’d like to. At this point I’ve done my current position for 2 years(appraisals), which personally was not difficult in any regard but kinda paid shit so I figured what the hell? I can get a double promotion and do something new. Well fuck me, I got 0 training and got tossed 80 files and was basically told good luck. Now I gotta say as someone who only worked in a small portion of the mortgage process, I knew absolutely dick all. I got a crash course with another processor who basically told me he’s only going to say things once. So this probably the first time in my life I’ve ever been overwhelmed to the point I considered quitting entirely. Every night at my desk holding my head in hands not knowing wtf I’m doing. SOMEHOW I close 40 of those loans on the first month, it took years off my life but I got it done. Get called into the managers office who wants to congratulate me on picking up the process so quickly and helping them out. At this point I bring it up that I’m still being paid my lower wage even tho I just closed about $30M in loans(company mostly worked with foreign nationals and all their $$$). This guy has the audacity to start telling me about how when he first started he wasn’t being paid what he should and that the company fairly compensated him later on (he’s a fcking vp)I almost hit that man, I told him I understood that that was what he chose to do but that I’m not him. So he later chooses to speak with another manager who calls me in and in a much more convincing way tells me she will get me the raise I’m asking for. So I wait 6 months before I got a raise and even then I was told that they couldn’t justify a higher pay to corporate because i had only been processing for 2 months at the time of employee valuations. It was further explained to me that corporate wasn’t aware that I was a processor, they had gotten me a raise by telling corporate I was doing so well in my previous position. Honestly I should have left then. But I stayed, come round the next evaluation and they’re telling the best they can do is now give me the title officially. I’m livid, COVID is starting and people are leaving in droves, my coworker whose been doing this 15 years tells me there’s a position at his old company and he’s going back to. you should apply he says. Takes me about 2-3 weeks to work up the courage to quit a job that pays for my livelihood. But I did it, tell him set up the interview I’m ready to leave. I get hired later that same day. Not even a hiring process really, it was one phone call to the manager who asked I take a simple mortgage knowledge test. I pass and now I’m at my new job. 32/h and I feel like I’m on top of the world! I was making $75 for every loan past 10 I closed. What an offer compared to my last job. A lot of stuff is happening at this point, I start making $$ and it’s all good. I even made $30k off doge. Until one day (3-4 months in) I woke up and realized, I fucking hate working/being alive. Have a nervous breakdown and I speak with HR and my manager and it kinda resolves itself, a couple months pass and I bought a home cause I could and no one in my family has owned a home before. This is when I really start spiraling again, there is so much to owning a home, I probably would’ve put it off another year if I’d known. So remember I said I had 0 training from my previous job? Well I get offered another position that is the same except they were gonna pay me $250 a loan if I work with these 2 loan officers. I think hell yea easy money. Well these ladies have been working the job 20 years and they stripped me of any self confidence I had left. Constantly pointing out things they would do differently and even saying “oh we thought you had more experience”, “our last processor knew about this” etc. it gets to the point that I mentally cannot accept what they’re saying anymore and I get put on leave for telling another coworker I wanted to kill myself(she ratted on me)So I’ve never been on mandatory leave before, get told disability can cover expenses but why don’t you wait a week before seeing a doc, first mistake. I just moved to norcal and have to wait to get a new patient #. Turns out if you don’t call the doctor right away they won’t back date the day I got put on leave. So I effectively lose 3 weeks of pay because it takes forever to get my new #. I’m shitting myself at this point, at home not making a dime, mortgage and bills that have to get paid. So I called HR and tell them hey I can’t not be working I’m gonna end up homeless.

So I’m working again, except I have no work and I believe I’m not being trusted to have files anymore. So I sit on my ass for 8 hours doing jack shit. Run a few reports and cover sometimes. And I’m spiraling again. Will they let me go? Why am I even working ? Why did I buy a home? Why do I bother staying alive? I spent the last couple days sleeping 15+ hours and crying while working cause I don’t have an answer and I’m afraid I won’t find one. I feel like working takes so much of my time and attention and for what? I don’t feel like I’ve accomplished anything and life is passing me by everyday. My home feels like chains.",1
"I feel like there has to be something wrong with me. I try so hard to be a good friend a good person and I get let down every time. I'm always there for people I consider friends, I check in them despite my horrible mental health, I make an effort to make fun plans, I try to give advice about whatever they need, I try my very hardest be a good friend to others. I have never gotten the same in return. I have trauma from past relationships which makes it harder for me to trust. I feel like every ""friend"" I've had has used me in one way or another. The most common theme is people using me as their emotional dumpster and then not caring about how i'm doing. When I have realized this was happening (in the past) I tried to nicely tell the person that I care about them, but there's just somethings I cannot handle/some days I can't listen to someone's problems without my mental health declining too. I know this happens to other people as well and I feel like this is valid (maybe i'm wrong) Every time i've tried this the person gets mad at me. This is now happening again with someone I thought I was close to. Sometimes I will be visibly upset and instead of this person just simply asking ""are you okay?"" they seem to ignore me. Sometimes just asking ""are you okay"" makes me feel a little bit better because i know someone cares enough to ask. When this friend was very sick a bit ago, I went out of my way to make her food, get her meds, made sure she had water and everything she needed. I know I didn't have to do that but that's what a good friend does in my book. I don't remember her even saying thank you. it hurts that i've cared so deeply for someone who doesn't seem to care for me at all. It hurts knowing that i've gone out of my way to make sure she's okay and she has never once done the same back. It hurts feeling like I wasted a few years on this fake friendship. I don't know how to stop this from happening. I feel like I will never find ""my people"" or friends who genuinely care about my well being. I have my boyfriend and sister who supports me but other than that I don't have anyone I can trust or call a friend. I can't even see them often because of school. I feel like a fucking alien at this point and I feel like I don't belong anywhere. I can feel my mental state getting worse everyday. I feel so alone.",1
"I just wet my pants while awake for quite possibly the first time in my life since I was toilet trained. I'm 22 years old. I knew I really had to go to the bathroom, but I didn't think it was THAT bad.

Last night I wet the bed, also quite possibly for the first time in my life. Thankfully I live alone and no one was staying over, but god, it's humiliating to be incontinent in my early 20s.

A few months ago my doctor said my antidepressants are probably causing me to lose some control over my pelvic floor. We talked about it because I kept getting UTIs, and she said it was likely due to that. I wasn't surprised by the difficulty reaching orgasm, but I'd never heard of antidepressants causing urinary problems.

I fucking hate this. This is the first medication out of so many that's worked for the better at all. Why can't I have a somewhat functional brain and control of my bladder at the same time? This is the stupidest fucking side effect. Why do I have to choose between a will to live and urinary continence? I don't have the strength to start trying other medications all over again. I just want a relatively functional body. Is that so much to ask?",1

I don't want to do anything. I just want to be normal, good person or just to dissapear. But i know that none of these options is possible. I have to work hard to change my life. But I can't do it without any motivation. 
My love felt bad when i told her that. She said she's not enough for me, she should motivate me bit she doesn't and she can't understand why i give up so easily and why I do not try to do something. We are together more than year and its still not enough for me... I didnt know how to answer... 
She needs me too. Maybe even more than I need her. She also has mental problems. And i hurt her very often which is painfull for me cuz I always try to do the right thing, I try to make her feel good but unfortunately I fail...

"I don't even know where to start but I have no one else to open up to about this and I need to get it off my chest.
I was brought up in a very loving home and to this day my parents are still my biggest supporters. I have nothing to complain about in my life, I moved to the city of my dreams, live in a very comfortable place with a great job and have pretty much everything which I am extremely grateful for but I can't help but feel like I'm starting to drown in loneliness. For the past two years, this feeling came and went like in waves. For the most part, my everyday life is just fine but sometimes I just spend my nights crying not knowing my purpose of life or where I'm going with no one by my side. It's extremely hard to explain how I feel but all I know is that it hurts. Although I have a great life here, I have no good or close friends that I can rely on. When I started my new job and they asked me for an emergency contact, I had no one to name. If I were to ever get sick or hospitalized, there wouldn't be anyone here for me except for my parents who are thousands miles away. It's gotten to a point where I feel I've gotten so deep into and used to loneliness that I don't know how to get out of it? Socializing has almost become like a chore for me and I'd rather stay in my corner no matter how much the loneliness hurts because socializing doesn't seem to alleviate anything for me for too long. At the end of the day, I find myself back in my cocoon. At first I liked and thought it was independence, which I believe it was to some extent, but now it's like I fell into a trap. I watch people with their families and friends around me and I'm constantly reminded that I have no experiences to share with anybody. When I'm at my lowest, I start distancing myself from my family and it's something that I wouldn't want to do but in these moments, I just want to be left alone. Since yesterday, I spend the whole day and night scrolling through my phone ignoring every message while I let my sadness and loneliness take over me. I don't know if anyone can relate, I'm not sure how exactly to put these feelings into words but I just needed to get this off my chest..",1
"Hey, idk really know how to say this but i feel like i need a place to vent. Over the last couple years i have realized that the personality i display in front of my friends isnt really me, and that I, the person i really am, is not someone to look up to or to respect. I feel like there are people who care about me and me beeing alive but at the same time i know that these people (including my family) dont know who i truly am. I know that they would be heartbroken if i actually were to kill myself but at the same time they dont actually know me, right? I am convinced by now that the fake personality i show to others has heavily influenced the way i used to think about myself, to the point that the only time i realized that i was liyng to myself was when i got drunk.
Im truly uncertain how to go on or even if i should go on after reflecting upon this. After learning that even most of my emotional reactions were tied to this fake character and that i cant even cry anymore, im not sure if i should just set an end to all of this as i dont even know how to start searching for a way out.",1
"I'm 27. Spent all 27 years single. Had sex only a few times, mainly because I didn't want to die a virgin (and you could really die at any time, let's be honest). 

Been really focused on my career, mainly because I had nothing else going on. Wasn't cool in high school or college. Was kind of a late bloomer. 

I got into med school. It's been making me miserable for the past two years. I was already not in a good place going in and now I'm full-blown dysfunctional due to the long hours of studying, the loneliness, the alienation, the hours, the degradation, the lack of free time.... Can't get out because of a huge amount of loans I've already taken out. 

I try dating here and there, when things are going smoothly. It'll start off okay with a guy, then it will just die down after date 3. Sometimes I do the rejecting because I sense the guy is not really into me and is having me around because of no other better option. Sometimes they prove me right and reject me. I can't even IMAGINE a guy falling for me. I CAN'T IMAGINE IT. 

I can't even be normal around men. I feel so small. I constantly feel like I have to prove myself. I hate my actual personality. I think everything about me is boring and unlikable.

"I’m sleeping through life and it’s hurting everyone. Everything is exhausting. I have no spoons. I can’t keep my life together anymore. Every facet of my life is suffering but I’m hiding it well enough, and I can’t tell if it’s trauma, grief, or just the usual mental illness making me this way. Maybe it’s all three. It’s exhausting. I’m tired. I’m too tired to check my phone or check up on the people I really care about. Just the thought of further disappointing anyone or having to apologize again while explaining away another depressive episode with a cheerful “But I’m feeling better now.” “But I’m on new meds now.” Exhausting. It’s enough to keep me from even looking through my notifications. I’m lucky enough to have access to good healthcare, and over the last 10 months I’ve had 3 grippy sock vacations without telling anyone I’m even leaving, except for the person I pay to catsit. Because at this point nobody actually cares, and those who do won’t for very much longer. I just disappear into the void for days at a time, realize my meds aren’t working and I can’t get out of this on my own because I hadn’t showered or eaten in days, then I call up my therapist like “It’s about to go down.” And she handles the rest. And I come back to my life a few days later with an apology to everyone who missed me, new meds and new hope. For a little while. At this point it feels cyclical. The ups and downs of this disease in my brain. This fucking defective electric meatball in my skull. I do not want to do this for the rest of my life. In the last two years I’ve made a habit of isolating when it gets bad, because I hate feeling like a burden on top of everything. And honestly, when I get like that, I hate feeling in general. And I hate that I isolated myself beyond repair and I fucking miss the people who used to love me. This constant battle is exhausting. I’ve had the diagnosis for 13 years now, and I want to live my fucking life. I’ve made it this far, but I am so tired of hoping it’ll get better. Or this new medication will work.

"I hope this is the right place to post this. I've had social anxiety my whole life. For the past few months, I've felt tired and kept making self destructive decisions in my life. I haven't felt this way since a very long time.

8 years ago, I stopped using heroin for the last time and have kept myself clean this whole time. tbh I didn't know back then it would be the last time I used, as I tried getting myself clean several times and somehow it was the last. The first few years was difficult because I lived almost in isolation in order to not relapse. 

Few years later I went to a foreign country, made personal connections and for the first time I felt a lot of emotions. Movies could make me cry, feel happy or sad. It was a great feeling because, before that I've always felt numb and disconnected like I didnt really exist.

But more recently, I've stopped enjoying things again. I no longer feel entertained, I just lie down and feel useless, but I do not feel the numbness I've felt before. I can still feel sad. I don't want to not feel anything again.

I dont know what to do, I always wanted to contribute to society or be useful to anyone while I am alive. I want to feel more connected, I want to overcome my social anxiety and fears. At the same time I dont want to talk about my past or traumas in detail to another person, as most of them are very personal to me.

 I need advice from anyone who can help.",1

Hello I honestly feel like I need to vent I work at a call center for a major car insurance company and I hate the call center environment. It is the most mundane and mind numbing job I have ever had I literally sit here holding back tears out of pure boredom and frustration. It wouldn't be as bad if they offered a work from home position but they do not. I have been applying elsewhere but no luck yet but It has gotten to the point that I go on breaks and lunches and come back 30 mins late because I will be sitting in my car just crying. I know it's not a huge concern but it definitely has been affecting my day to day life. (I am moving in two months to another city and everyone's advice is just to rough it out till then but I literally don't even think I can rough out the remainder of the shift that I am currently on. Much less an entire 2 months ),1
"Seriously. When you have no social life, no money, no looks, no personality, what's the point on going on through life? Just so I can work to live once I'm kicked out of the place I live? So people can look at me and think ""Man I'm sure glad I'm more fortunate than that poor girl"". So I can enslave myself to anyone that shows me the smallest bit of kindness and be thrown to the side?

The only reason I stick around is because of my cat, as pathetic as that sounds. I just have this thing where I need to be absolutely needed. Probably because despite what I think and type I am incredibly scared of death, and need excuses to be a coward about it, and not commit to it.",1
"So, my sister went to Jamaica with her family. She got covid and was quarantined there for ten days after the rest of her fam left. Not minimizing this struggle at all - I’m sure it was hard as hell!! And she’s upset that family members didn’t reach out and she felt alone and now she’s going to therapy to “unpack”.

It’s just so wildly frustrating to me. Not a soul “reached out” to me when I was partially hospitalized and suicidal. No one told me I was brave for getting help or how awful it was that no one texted me while I was in treatment. 

Maybe I should have been louder about it? Idek I’m just sad and mad.",1
"i’m just going to use this post as some form of outlet. i’m slowly starting to grow tired of day to day life. i like sleeping in as long as my parents allow so i get to experience less of the waking day. i watch the clock throughout the day seeing the hours pass by, knowing that in so many hours everyone will have gone to bed, and i am left alone with my problems. every problem for me except debt is internal. i am the cause and effect of every single one. there is no cure, there is nothing i can do to ease my pain except the day’s distractions. they are exactly that, distractions, that take away from the real picture, i am the problem. the self harm has been nightly and it has been vicious. there is no other way to translate my pain aside from putting it into words or experiencing pain physically. nothing moves, i feel like i am experiencing the same day over and over, but that is just the thing, every day is the same because i am the same. i don’t want to kill myself, i just want to cease to exist. i don’t know how much longer i can go on. there is no solution, and though people will reach out with their words and advice, it does nothing to make me not realize that i am the problem. it feels like a forest fire in my brain that just resets every night and restarts again the exact same the minute i wake up, beginning as a small ignition and builds all the way up again. all i want to do is be with the girl i like the most, and although the feeling is mutual she still won’t accept that we should be together. she’s off at uni hours away from me, talking to god knows who. i need it to end. i need the pain to end. they should have medically induced comas available for people like me who can just stop their reality but still make it possible for loved ones to visit your living body. to know that it’s going to be like this forever and the more i talk about it makes me feel like there is a massive tidal wave just building in front of me. i don’t want my family to have to come across my dead body but what other end is there? and i appreciate the sentiment of anyone who tells me that things will get better, but when you are the problem, it only falls on deaf ears.",1
They figure out that you're always upset. That you always want to cry and need someone to comfort you. They stop reaching out. They stop trying as hard. They dotn respond when they ask you how you are and you tell them you're crying. They don't even ask why anymore. It's just natural. Why would they care? It's all you ever are.,1

"So my luck has never been what I would call great. I always seem to get screwed over randomly. To start with I use to take care of my mom who had early onset dementia. She wasn’t super bad just forgetful and scatter brained at times . Around the time when covid started to become worrisome and then lock down occurred I was very worried for my mom. Her health wasn’t the greatest so I was always on her about wearing her mask when out and using hand sanitizer. Well everything was fine til they started to lift lock down in the summer at the end of June and I could return to my job . I ended up catching it and did my best to self isolate but it wasn’t good enough. She ended up catching it from me and passing 18 days later. I ended up going through long term covid symptoms that ended up in being miss diagnosed and then forced back to work even though I couldn’t walk 30 feet without breathing extremely hard. I ended up passing out at work and rushed to the hospital. I was then diagnosed with multiple blood clots in both my lungs . So I went back out on sick leave but due to my jobs policy’s I had to file for social security disability. And until their determination I was not paid . Fast forward 4 months and I have returned back to work but I have used all my savings and lost my home and had to move 45 min away in order to keep my moms dogs . With the sale of my home coming up all the guilt and stress of finances have finally broken me . I cry almost daily and often fantasize about just throwing in the towel. I have never been one to quit when things get tough but I just feel like there is no hope. I have 2 sisters but they honestly could care less about me unless it benefits them. I’m all alone. Even when I had to clean out my moms house they didn’t help, I begged them and was told they have bad memories there so they were not stepping one foot near there. So I’m at a loss I don’t have anyone I can talk to and all my feelings are just eating me up. I have been looking for a therapist. I just thought I would reach out and see what others thought.",1
"I have battled with depression and anxiety since I was around 13, I am now 17. I was oblivious to my anxiousness as I didn't understand it but ive been aware of my depression since I was very young. I am the eldest sibling and have 4 half brothers and 1 half sister (2 half brothers on my fathers side,2 half brothers and half sister on mothers side) due to me only having half siblings I view them as all I have really. I was very young when my parents split up so its never really affected me in that sense, however I would always spend weekends at my dad as well as one of my brothers would his name was Bailey he's the closest sibling to my age so we would do everything together like literally everything. lmao im getting emotional already.. we spent a good few years like this until there was a family issue between my father and my brothers mum, for whatever reason they had split up and now my dad and I cannot see my little brother. this affected me massively but I kept it to myself because I didn't want to upset my dad as he could not see him either. I've been more open about these problems to my mum as I live with her so I did eventually tell her how I miss being in contact with them and could we see them. so my mother got in contact we met once or twice and then it went to shit again for what reason I don't know. I reached out to Bailey around 9 months ago and we spoke, it took me ages to find his Instagram as his mum changed his surname we shared to her own... in the brief convo he eventually said ""I thought you had forgot me"" and I said ""your my brother and I would never forget you"" it made me feel relieved that he knew who I was and hadn't forgot me and that we was thinking the same thing about each other. around 5 months go by and my dad calls me crying insisting to speak to my mum. I knew something was wrong as my dad would never ever do this. my mum and dad spoke for a couple minutes and partly my instinct but I thought id assume for the worse so I could hope to get a better answer so I asked my mum ""what's happened to Bailey? is Bailey dead"" it turns out he had died, at the time I didn't know how and was only trying to figure out how. couple mins later I over hear on the phone call how my little brother had hung himself. its months later and I think about him everyday I miss him so much I wish I said more to him in our small conversation for whatever reason he had blocked me on instagram im not sure when but I believe and truly hope this is because he told his mum that we spoke and his mother didn't want him to get close with his dad again so he was told to remove me or whatever. I wish I told him I struggled mentally too and that he wasn't alone I did everything I could to try everyday hurts so much. im sorry for waffling and shit but yeah. I love you so much Bailey",1
"Does anyone else struggle with feeling down at major social life events?

I’m in my mid-thirties, so I’m in that time of my life where the people around me are either getting married or they’re having kids. This year in particular I’ve been to three different weddings, and two of them have been basically back-to-back, on successive weekends. Before the first of the two, I made a comment to some friends (who were all going to the second of the two) that “I hate weddings”. It’s something that I’ve always felt, without really having an explanation for, and I usually pass it off as a joke about me being a curmudgeon. However, after the second of the two weddings, I’ve been able to put a finger on why.

It’s not that I hate weddings. It’s that I hate how I *feel* at weddings.

Part of it is the sensory overload - so many unfamiliar faces, in an event that’s supposed to bring us together to celebrate - but it’s mostly the drinking, dancing, and elevated mood that ruins things for me. These are all things that I either don’t do or struggle to achieve and, as a result, I end up retreating into myself to cope. Unfortunately, when I do that, there’s only one thought waiting for me on the inside—

*I hate myself.*

I hate the way that I look. I hate my face, I hate my body. I hate the way that I think, I hate the way that I speak, I hate the way that I feel. I hate how awful I feel like I look trying to dress up, and most of all I hate how much standing off to the side because I don’t dance or drink makes me feel like I’m acting like an attention-seeker. I hate feeling like a burden.

And so, left with all of that, I just retreat further. I feel like everyone is capable of these big, positive emotions that are just beyond me. I feel like everyone else is so free and vibrant, while my depression is just wrapping around me like a big dark cloud. I feel like everyone else can see that I’m not enjoying myself, and I feel like they’re talking about it. 

At the most recent wedding, sitting at a table with the same friends that I told that “I hate weddings,” I *know* they were talking about it, because I interrupted their conversation. Another friend asked if I was OK, and all I could say was “There’s just a lot going on. It’s overwhelming.” Because what am I supposed to say? “Yeah, I’m fine. I’m just waiting until it’s socially acceptable to leave, because I just want to go somewhere to be alone and die?” This is someone else’s wedding. This is about *them*, not *me*; and it’s not their *event* that’s bringing me down, it’s *me* bringing *myself* down. 

And the truth of the matter is, it’s all cyclical: I retreat inside of myself, where all of my feelings of self-loathing are waiting, because I don’t drink, dance, or celebrate. *But* I don’t drink, dance, or celebrate *because* I hate myself, and don’t feel like I’m able to do those things. Clearly, the root of the issues - both my inability to take part, and feeling down because I can’t - stems from the same feeling: *I hate myself.*

So, it’s not that “I hate weddings”, it’s that *I hate myself,* and being at weddings forces me to confront that, so I hate the way that I feel at weddings.

I don’t see a way out of this. After so many years, this is just my baseline, carefully hidden under layers of other things. I feel like all I can do is wait until this time in my life passes; let people have families, and children, and gradually let me go until I’m all alone.

At least I won’t have to go to any weddings then.",1
"18/Male, Had a Mazda3 for 8 months. 

I don’t feel like going into details right now but I got in my first car crash last night. Completely not my fault and it was essentially a hit and run. 

Hella police arrived to the scene and I had to give the run down to like 3 different cops and they pretty much asked me for the car and the drivers description and told me there was nothing they can really do. 

(Since my stupid ass didn’t take a picture of the mans license plate + no street cameras) 

I got a ticket for no insurance and I’m probably gonna get a whole lot of impound/towing fees which I am not happy with considering that I’m unemployed at the moment. 

This will most likely put me in debt for the first time ever in my life. 

The reason I’m posting this in this subreddit instead of some car crash shit is because I used to be depressed and suicidal for a majority of my childhood and teen years and it wasn’t until mid 2020 that I got my shit together and saved up money for my first car. The Mazda 3.

It helped me a lot mentally. I found my ego, learned confidence and improved my social skills. I was content with my life for the most part. 

Right now I’m very worried that I might fall back into that dark pit of mental abyss and struggle to even think normally. 

It all feels like a fucking nightmare I haven’t woken up from yet…",1
"I survived 19 years without anyone giving a shit about me. It just seems absurd. And I don't have any hope left that it would ever change. It's way easier to think of yourself as someone unfit for the society. Someone that no one finds interesting or worth friendship with. I am not even mentioning relationship, because there is no fucking way it would ever happen to me. Other girls that I knew were always getting attention from someone, but I never got any in my entire life, even though I mainly hang out with guys. There is just something wrong with me and I just wish that I've never been born.",1
"Im 25 now and I never saw my self going past 21. It’s like I’m just living to stay alive for others. It’s been like this for 10 years now. Relationships make it better for only a short while but then I feel disgusted in my self for being around people. Yet I do everything to keep things clean and good. I don’t find joy in anything I do. I feel empty. Hollow to the point where I don’t want to even do the things I use to like.

Maybe it’s me or maybe it’s because everyone around me disappears till I’m useful in something. I feel like I don’t belong. Like I’m a burden to everyone and that I’m never enough. It’s getting to the point where I wish I don’t wake up the next day. I’m more scared that I’m getting to those ways again after I thought I finally moved past it. 

Don’t know if it’s odd that I want to disappear and start over somewhere else. Just boom vanish one day.

Sorry for the rant it’s just my brain is a mess and don’t even know where to start.",1
"I made a reddit and instagram account today for the first time because I'm tired of being alone. Ever since the pandemic hit I started struggling a lot with depression and now that the world is opening back up much more, I have a ton of social anxiety. I used to make friends pretty easy and loved going to social events but now I barely even leave my house. I know in person friendships are important to have, but while I don't have many, I was hoping to at least make some online.

"So I'm supposed to go to college so that I can then get a job, and then once I have a job and I meet someone we buy a house together and immediately start having babies, and then I just continue going to work every single day as does my significant other, the children's slowly get older, growing up in a school system that is essentially just a prison, then they move out and do the exact same thing and then I die. And that's it? And after a lifetime of that we're expected to believe that heaven is just more of this but it never ends? Truly what is the point to this existence? What is it that we actually accomplish by being here? Even if you do none of those things, still life is pointless. There's nothing worth doing and no pleasure lasts. We just function as cogs in a big machine. It's all nothing more than a waste of time",1
"So….I’m a 25yo male living by myself with my dog.

This was a rough year, that somehow I managed to get through. A lot of personal and professional crisis I’ve dealt, that really tested me on what I was able to get through.

Not unmarked though. I was diagnosed with GAD and Depression 2 years ago, and been on medication ever since. After not revising doses for almost a year and a half, I’ve started doing my follow-ups with family medicine doctor. She added a medication after a burnout, and months later while in another mental health crisis, and due to her not being available anymore, I’ve changed to another family medicine doctor and he changed one of my medications.

Right now I’m on an incredible mental health crisis again. The biggest difference is….I shouldn’t be. There’s nothing practical that is stretching my limits of stress. Things at work are good, things with relationships are good, but inside….I’m a mess, hence the storm.

My therapist suddenly pasted away in the first half of the year. After months without therapy, on said crisis I decided to go back to it. Tried with one that I didn’t really connected with, so I switched and found one that clicked. 

This one dumped me this week, with the orientation to find a specialized in mental health issues, because he wouldn’t be able to help me. The cherry on top was diagnosing me also with bipolar disorder.

I’m currently recovering from a pharyngitis I’ve acquired on last weekend that is kicking my ass, along with gingivitis that I’m on medication pre treatment. 

So yeah, this may be the only not great thing at the moment. Also I wasn’t able to go to the gym this week (I tried one day, and retarded my recovery) that is my main coping mechanism for dealing with my mental health.

Today was a shitty shitty day. Early morning I went from not feeling great, to feeling amazing, to not feeling great in a span of 3 hours. 

I’ve decided to watch “Genius by Stephen Hawking”, and although this is a subject that I love and that I’m really curious about it, after two hours I entered a big mental crisis where I froze in bed, while anxiety, rushed thoughts and derealization rushed through my head.

After an hour I was able to start to recover from it. I had some McDonalds and tried to get some professional help, by calling a special hotline for mental crisis that my workplace provides. That went wrong and along with not receiving any empathy by the psychiatrist, the only orientation I got was to get was to try to schedule an appointment next week. 

I think she didn’t take me as seriously as she should have because I’ve told her I’m not suicidal. Which is funny, because I feel the emptiness and hopelessness that make people suicide, and feel that feeling of wanting to make this stop, but at the same time, I don’t feel like taking my life right now, despite my head telling me it’s the easiest choice.

Yeah, so, after that shitshow, I cancelled my plans for the evening (and because I’m still recovering from the pharyngitis, although this was planned more than 2 months ago), and got some sleep for trying to stop my head.

Felt great while sleeping, woke up and was still not great. I took a shower and sat here on my sofa, where I am all in silence for more or less two hours without doing anything, besides writing this lengthy post, waiting for sleep time to try to rest and not enter a spiral again.

So yeah….I’m….not good. I’ve isolated myself today from everyone so I won’t be a burden to anyone. I’ve stopped myself of venting with my best friend because I’m honestly repeating myself and throwing all at him.

My parents live close, but besides being good parents, they think this issues are a lack of faith/religion and are unfortunately one of the causes for me having such a messed up mental health.

I love helping people, but in my head, this is a battle that I need to face alone. I’ve never had a romantic relationship and honestly, don’t think I’ll ever be able to, despite feeling the need to, because it’s not fair of me to put anyone in this tornado that is my mental health. 

So here I am, shouting into the vastness of the void that is the internet, for at least taking this off my chest. If anyone has something to say that would help, I’d be glad to here it. Because right now, I’m not giving up on the battle, but boy oh boy, I’m exhausted and taking one hell of a beating that seems endless.

_____________________

TL;DR:

So, shit’s funny. 

I look around and don’t see any big crisis or issues that I have. I’m honestly exactly where I think I should be. I worked my ass off to be where I am and I feel grateful and proud of all I’ve achieved in the last 10 months, despite being the hardest year of my life.

At the same time I’m on the worst mental crisis that I ever had, and despite having suicidal ideations, don’t feel like actually doing it. My medication for sure is off balance, and I’m currently on the search for a new therapist.

If anyone has something to say that thinks would help, I’d be glad to hear it, because although I’m not giving up, I’m exhausted and taking a beating.",1
"Hey everyone. Anyone with depression will know that this affects your libido.

He on the other hand has just spilled the beans once drunk. He states he feels unloved, despite all the attention and non sexual intimacy I provide him with. He, in a drunken upset has stated that “his friends think we’re weird that we only have it once a week” and he said even my mam and dad have it more than us” and honestly I am so shocked and upset.

i’ve been struggling with depression again for the last two months and it’s pretty severe at times. i lost friends and usually it wouldn’t take a big toll on me but this time is different. it’s been super hard lately and my only friend is my boyfriend but we’re long distance. he’s busy with studies and his own social life and i don’t really want to take away from that so i kind of just keep quiet about my feelings in a way. i really wish i had friends that i could hangout with and pass the time. i haven’t left my house to hangout with someone in months and it’s making me feel really sad and extremely lonely. people in my group therapy have said try going to cafes and such but i get overwhelmed in social settings pretty fast. if anyone has any tips on how to get out there with severe social anxiety or any other tips i would appreciate it. just ranting about it feels nice :).,1
"I am going to see the psychiatrist on Monday. The last few months, and certain periods of my life, I've wondered ""do I have depression?"" Then I'll reason myself into thinking I dont. I think I have just come to terms with the fact that I have either mild or high-functioning depression at least. I took the DASS test online and it said I have moderate depression, normal anxiety and mild stress.
My symptoms:
1) I seem to not feel joy when something good happens. Back in December last year, I bought a Nintendo Switch to keep myself occupied. Till now I've only played it 5 times and have no interest in it.
In March I got news that I got a scholarship and I was just like ""hmm....meh."" 2) I've lost interest in lots of things I found fun and can't seem to be bother to make the initiative. I was totally into this book, yet I havent been bothered to read it since April. I enjoy hiking and watching anime/tv series and yet I have not had the initiative to do so. These hobbies feel like hard work to even start. I also like going to the gym. I am starting to lose interest in that. On the days I do go, I don't do a full workout.
3) I get tired easily. Sometimes I make plans with people and cancel simply because I feel like it'll be tiring for me. When I am out, part of me feels like I really just want to go home and lie down.
Even when I go out alone, I just want to go home and lie down because I get tired easily.
4) I'm also losing interest in school. I've been having trouble being motivated to do work.
5) I feel hungry but eating feels like a chore. Sometimes Id rather snack on things during the day and have a meal before I sleep
6) My sleeping pattern hasnt changed much but I does not feel restful.
I DO NOT have any self-harm or suicidal ideation.
I still seem to be able to carry on with things but even small things feel like hard work sometimes

For some context, I am international student in Japan and due to covid I am homesick as I havent been able to see my family in 31 months.
In July and August, I defended my Master's thesis and took the entrance exam for my PhD course (which I passed).
---
I mentioned to my Prof on Wednesday that I feel depressed (but I did not mention the symptoms) and he seemed supportive. Told me I can have a break, lots of foreign students in Japan and even some local Japanese students in our department has developed depression, especially during this difficult time.
Then today, unsurprisingly he had a different tone. I never told him about my symptoms, I only said I think I have depression and I want to get it checked. Yet tofay he told me he thinks I'm just burnt out and tired because I am not like the other students who are depressed (he said this because I seem to be functioning properly.)

Guess my question is, do I seem to have depression?",1
"I could've been such a fucking masterpiece. Excellent grades, good friends, good job, physically fit

I made this one fucking mistake 4 years ago, and now I'm a stupid, fat, useless fucking loser whose completely alone in a world with more than 7,000,000,000 people. Fuck",1
"i tried being ""a good kid"" to my mother n brought her n my uncle food from mcdonalds (uncle kept asking for a burger). she accused me of stealing 100€ instead lol

why even try? i dont deserve to have a good connection to anyone. i should stop existing. 
huh.... 
my grandparents r also mad at me for not defending myself. (like more than saying i didnt do it) theyre mad that i cant open my mouth further.",1
"I've had a pretty decent life up until a while back. I had friends, going out, in college, etc. It was fine. I was always depressed, but on ""highs"" or ""lows"", but a lot of time I had either friends or my girlfriend to rely to, for comfort, etc. Then the pandemic hit, and I finished my last two years of college online losing almost all connections with college people. This summer, me and my girlfriends split after a 5 year relation ( Entire College + last year of highschool). I am 23 years old, I lost a lot of friends(That were more ""her friends"", and now that is way more obvious), I'm out of College/school, so its incredibly hard to meet people. I've gone ""out""(something that i was used to before) in the last 2 months once i think. All of those got me into probably the lowest low I've ever been. I never had suicidal toughts, and still dont have, but that doesnt mean that I'm not really low. I don't know what to do. Its so hard to meet people in mid 20's, for a shy person, that is out of ""collectives""(school/college). I've gained weight too. Everything i said before barely scratches the surface of the many things that make me depressed, and I dont know how to get over it, because I know fixing some of my problems might help(losing weight, meeting people, dating, talking more with my parents/friends, etc), but I cant get myself to do any. I dont know how to.... I know its pretty vague, but I'd aprecciate any advice u have, because I feel at the lowest low I've ever been, and really feel like leaving everything behind. I might have repeat myself, or have a pretty poor english, sorry for that, hope you can make something out of what I said.",1
"I’m 20, I’ve been actively depressed for 5+ years, I learned about my BPD a year ago and have slowly been coming to terms with it. It’s been hard, therapy has been helping but also opening up old wounds. 

It’s like having your eyes opened… realising that in fact you did not have a perfect childhood and that emotional abuse and neglect take on different forms. Sitting at family dinners and screaming in your head “this is the reason I want to die”, not being capable of living the life you want because you physically don’t have the energy, slowly breaking from the inside out… 

I’ve never been good with death, with endings in general. Just thinking about how much more pain I will have to endure in the future hurts so fucking much. Being suicidal feels like constant trade-off between my loved ones and me. The thing I want most will hurt them the most. I know there is no way without pain. Either I die and pass the pain onto them, or I wait until they die feeling every single one of their deaths. 

I’ve never had this notion of “Thank god I’m alive”, I can’t really remember a time when I preferred living but recently… 
I want to die every second of every day. I haven’t lived for myself in a long time, but at least I tried to make living as pleasant as possible… now I just go through the motion on autopilot. It feels like constant dissociating. I know I’ve mentally given up. I’m alive because I have to be and I keep wondering how long it’ll take until the pain overpowers even that. 


(Disclaimer: this is in way promoting suicide. I’m not a danger to myself or anyone else and I’m taking steps to get better.)",1
I have done everything im supposed to i went to therapy i talked to family and friends i tried dealing with it alone i tried distracting myself i tried toughing it out it wont go away it wont go away i dont know what to do my life is falling apart i cant do anything and i hate myself more and more every single day what the fuck do i do,1
"Before you answer let me tell you a little about my situation. I have busted my ass to get where am I am. I have a technical degree and a job making six figures. This is extremely good money where I live and I work for one of, if not the best, employers in my area. I had a child with a horrible woman who has done everything to make my life a living hell. However, I am very involved in my kids life. The only reason I believe I strive so hard to have a career and make good money is for my child. I love my child but she is so disrespectful to me at times and her mom is just so horrible to me.
I'm in my early 30s and I want to get married. I have been basicly single since having my child (nearly 8 years). Yet, I want nothing more than to find someone and get married. I make such good money that I could provide such a good life for all of us. However, I can't find anyone and I suspect it's because of my depression.
My depression really began shortly after the mother of my child left. It has lifted for certain periods but the last 3 years it has just steadily gotten worse. It has robbed me of my energy. All I have time for is work, my house, and my daughter. My work has suffered because of it and I feel my daughter is disrespecting me for it as well. I'm exhausted all the time. I've given up my hobbies and most all things I enjoy. I'm just constantly depressed and want to sleep. I have come to the conclusion that I might be able to break this depression by quitting my job. If I quit my job I'll have so much more time to get back to doing the things I love and spending quality time with my daughter. It will give me a chance to travel and get some good vibes going again. If I am feeling good again I know I'll attract someone. Women are attracted to me now but I feel like as soon I speak they can just feel the depression in my voice. I have enough money saved to pay my bills and mortgage for at least 1 year. It is possible that I will be fired anyway because the work I have done lately is so poor in quality. Has anyone on here been in this situation? Should I take a chance and quit my job to try to take my life back?",1
"I really need a place to vent. I'm in the military (US) and even though we're given the ""we want to help you"" talks, there's still a huge stigma attached to depression and they brush you aside unless you're ""I'm going to fucking off myself"". Probably because suicide makes the military looks bad. 

Anyways this year has been incredibly rough for me. I got stationed overseas at a small unit with a different culture and language. I thought it was awesome at first until I realized you can't outrun depression. I already find it hard to make friends but it's never been so difficult when you're in a new country. All my coworkers have kids and live in off base housing. They all keep to themselves which is why I've been unable to make a friend here. I think the worst part has been being put in barracks. I don't have a roommate which I would prefer because at least I'd have someone to talk to. I had two cats at my last unit and they were essentially my emotional support animals. No matter how lonely I felt, I had them. I knew they needed me and loved me. I haven't seen them in a year as they're staying with an acquaintance. 

My life is essentially sitting in my room waiting to go to work. I have zero motivation to do anything, I don't recieve pleasure from doing any of my hobbies if I can even force myself to do them. My only social interaction is with my coworkers. I don't really have any family. Friends only last till you move to the next unit. I honestly fucking hate my life. 

I'm not even getting paid well to incentivize being here. I feel myself becoming increasingly more bitter about the military and my life as time goes on. I hate that I can't quit because I have a contract to fulfill. I hate this country that the only way I could get medical insurance and afford it was by signing years of my life away. I hate that the military treats you like a fucking child unless you're married. 

But what really pushed me to make this post, it's my birthday and I didn't get a single person wishing me a good day. I spent the day crying lying in bed and watching Christmas movies. I've never been at a point in my life where I'm disappointed to wake up in the morning but here I am.",1
"for most of my years on this earth i’ve felt great shame, a sense of loss and deep rejection towards my body. searching endlessly for belonging, for acceptance, for a deeper knowing of myself. i lost myself over and over in a desperate attempt to be anything other than who i thought i was. 

i turned 19 a few weeks ago i remember devoting myself to my pain after high school. such a sad persona i molded myself into. i was in love with feeling miserable. it was comfortable. back then in my eyes happiness was always risky because it was never permanent. but all emotions are temporary and existence shouldn’t be dictated by emotions. 

ive been working on purging and releasing. forgiveness and compassion. my past is something i continually face. acknowledging all the wrath &amp; cruelty i used to emanate through. finding the roots of it always lead me back to being a little girl. for the past year ive been seeing all the uglinesses &amp; dense aspects of me. hate is a very very heavily distorted &amp; dense energy. i was full of it!!! i was so angry so so angry. i never knew where this anger came from i was so deep in my own deception. 
and still it feels bare. seeing beneath the physical body but wanting more. surrounded by people but consumed by your presence. i need deep healing",1
"It's been so many years now and it never gets better. It's only ever gotten worse. Every year it gets harder. What am I supposed to do ?

Jesus, I'm so lonely and miserable... so tired

Does it ever really get better? I need a little hope here😞",1
Why do I even bother trying to continue to live? I don’t want to work AT ALL. If I could get paid to play video games or for ANYTHING that I enjoy anymore that would be fantastic. But that’s never gonna happen. I’m gonna hate myself for the rest of my life so I might as well end it. Thanks for reading this. Goodbye.,1

"Sometimes I think about what I would write in my suicide note. Who would I mention? Who do I owe a goodbye? My family for sure. It would hurt them the most, they’re the only reason I haven’t yet so I know I would owe them an apology. Would I tell them about the things I couldn’t before? Give them the password to this note and all my other secret little accounts I rant on so they don’t have to wonder what was going through my head? I don’t know if I can take knowing they see how horribly fucked up I am. I honestly don’t think they would understand. I think I would want my best friend to know that a lot of the time I was biting back tears. That I wish she didn’t follow me because for me, this was running. A frantic escape to what I was desperately and naively thinking could possibly be a better life. I wish I could tell her how much I missed when it was just us in first year. I know thats selfish because she was miserable. So was I, but at least I wasn’t alone, misery loves company after all. I wish I could go back to before she started dating her boyfriend and brought home with her all the things I was running from. Now that I know my role was so temporary and I was so easily replaceable, I can see how I’ll always need her more than she needs me. Another burden I’ve made someone else bear. I think I’ll stop that now. Needing people, I mean. It hurts too much. I know they don’t think of me much anymore and I was never their number one’s or anything, but to my childhood friends, I would say thank you for giving me the best years of my life. When we were those stupid kids playing house after school and pretending to be wizards and shit, I was happy, and that means a lot to me now. I would also say fuck you. For how little it meant to you, for how easily you forgot about it. Fuck you for not needing those memories as much as I do. And to everyone, I’m so fucking sorry. I’m sorry I couldn’t be me around you. I’m sorry I hated myself so much I hid. I know it made you feel like I didn’t care because thats how I wanted it to seem. I was scared. I knew you didn’t love me, but it would be so much harder to convince myself it would be okay during those times I couldn’t stop crying if I didn’t have those superficial ‘I love you’s’ you gave so easily to the little of me I allowed you to know. At least there was a tiny bit inside of me I could tell myself was loved. And finally, to you. I have so much I want to say. You taught me more than anyone ever has and I want to thank you. You fucking broke me. No, actually, because of you, I broke myself. Only after breaking your heart and making you cry did I realize how truly fucking horrible I am. How I can twist and tear and smash the pieces of myself back together as much as I like but I’ll never be as pretty as the original. A poor imitation of the role you needed me to fill was all I could ever be and I’m sorry it hurt you, but I’m so glad I left before I brought you down with me. I know how much you hated it and how shitty it made you feel, but if this was real, I would be selfish one more time and tell you I’m sorry. Because I should’ve been stronger. I should’ve stopped myself before I got close, before I stupidly convinced myself I could maybe have something good. And because I’m still too weak to actually do it, I’m sorry that I’ll keep being this way. I’m sorry I can’t change no matter how hard I try to fix the mess i’ve made of myself. I’m sorry I’m going to keep brining you down. I wish I could stop somehow. I’ll keep trying for you guys. If I cant stop burdening you, I can at least punish myself for it so I’ll keep trying. I’m sorry.",1

I give up. I feel like I’ve given life way too many chances. I try and I try and it just gets worse. I have no one, sometimes I think I do but then they always leave. I’ve changed, I’ve lost weight, gained weight, dyed my hair several different colours, changed my style and attitude multiple times and nothing changes. I don’t know what to do, I can’t do anything. Im so lonely and I hate myself, I feel gross and fat and my head hurts so so so much I can’t even cry anymore I don’t feel anything.",1
"I don’t think I am depressed. I just get melancholy. I have been dumped by my bf of ten years recently. I am kinda lonely. But I am not in bed crying all day. I go out. I watch random youtube vids. I panic about my weight. I hook up occasionally. I am not depressed. But occasionally, late at night, or late in the afternoon, I feel tired, no will to live, more akin to laziness, physical heaviness and a voice in my head says, “ and he killed himself.” I ignore the voice and never think about suicide again. I know I can’t do it. I know I won’t but every few days the voice returns with the ominous statement. I treat it like a cloud, it comes and goes, I am not attached to it. 

I just wanted to share that.",1
"I remember the first time I had suicidal thoughts I was around 16 in high school. Of course it was scary, and most of the time it was probably me being over dramatic about teen stuff. Six years later, I’ve learned a lot about my depression and suicidal ideation. For a lot of us, myself included, suicide became a defense mechanism, a programmed default response to stress (of all magnitudes, big or small). Suicidal thoughts became a comfort zone as warm as a fireplace in a cabin in the winter. Suicide and all of its intricacies—the planning, the self-loathing, the severity, the power and control—all of it aggregates to a perfect feeling/mental state that lives inside you rent free. Funny thing is that it’s always felt surreal until recently. Life’s gotten so painful and exhausting that I can finally see myself going through with it one day. I’m going to spend as much time with my family as possible, try to make life better in the ways that I can in the next decade or so, but from now on I have decided my depression is terminal and that I will designate myself an end date. I will kill myself in the future.",1

"So I don’t really know if what I have is depression or but I always have this ache in my heart that just wants to go to another world or to just constantly be dreaming and not have to deal with all of the pain and hardships and problems of life.

I’m also confused wether or not this depression because I’m generally a happy person but I can’t tell if it’s my actual emotions or if it’s just a face I’ve learned to put on. Don’t get me wrong tho I know when I’m truly happy it’s just that sometimes it gets really confusing about which one is actually happening.

i hate the way i look. i hate how my hair never ceases to look as though it hasn’t been brushed in a couple of weeks to a year even though its thoroughly brushed every day for at least 15 minutes. 

i hate how i feel when i look in the mirror. the person looking back at me doesn’t even feel like me. it’s like i’m just watching through the eyes of completely different. it’s gotten to the point where i can barely look into the mirror myself and often avoid even looking in the direction of them to prevent disappointment when i see myself. it’s hard and makes me cry thinking about it a lot. normally silently in bed as i don’t wish to worry anyone. 

i hate how i feel jealous about my siblings and friends faces. they’re all so gorgeous no matter what they do. with their neatly combed hair and never ceasing smiles. i hate how ill never be as pretty or talented as them. how my face, with the round bubbled nose will never compare to their sharply precisely shaped noses. all so straight and angelic looking. whilst mine makes me look worse than i already do and doesn’t compliment anything else on my face 

i hate how i cant love myself. it’s tiring and frustrating never liking your personality or appearance. never feeling like your enough and constantly wondering why certain people don’t like your asking yourself if it’s you or if it’s them is so , so draining both mentally and physically. 

i hate how i can never feel fully happy anymore . there’s always somethin mingling at the back of my head making me wonder if i’m supposed or allowed to be happy .

I had absolutely no idea what she was talking about but it is the third time she has made absurd false allegations against me or another guy. I told her I did not make any noise and she is crazy if she thinks so. She walks out the door, then back in 3 minutes later, livid, giving me a mad dog stare and says ""Fuck you"" and other things to that effect. Completely unfounded.

"Hi I’m a 23 year old girl

I’m in my junior year of college and I commute about an hour every morning and 35 minutes home (traffic lol). I’m studying human services but I’m so unsure of what I want to do in life.

"# 

Hi everyone. I’ve been dealing with depression since my father died. It started to subside a lot when I was doing a placement that I enjoyed. For my placement, I have been working as a researcher for a local politician in my community. For the first month, things had been going absolutely WONDERFUL! The constituency assistant that I report to had been giving me a lot of important tasks, and everyone told me how helpful my research has been. It was such a great feeling because it was the happiest I had ever been since my dad passed away in January. He was my best friend and the loss of him continues to hit very hard, especially since I was only 23 when he died. Up until I got my placement, I had very little hope for the future. However, these feelings changed when I became very successful in the I work had been doing for my placement. I was even invited to attend a meeting with the politician himself, who thanked me for my research and told me that he would like to meet and chat with me soon. This gave me so much hope because I was worried if I would be very useful to the team.

After I met him though, the constituency assistant stopped giving me work. Even when I message her to ask if she needs anything, she will either not respond, or tell me that she doesn’t need anything. I went from doing so many things every day, to barely doing anything for over 3 weeks. This all happened after the politician complimented me on my work and said he wanted to meet with me.

I’m so down now. I feel like the C.A prevented me from growing and having a future at the placement. This was the happiest I had been in months and she took it all away. I really enjoyed the work too. My placement is ending soon and I doubt I will be able to meet with the politician because of the C.A isn’t giving me any more opportunities. I don’t have any motivation for anything right now. . I just want to lay in bed. Can anyone please send some nice or encouraging words for me to bring myself to work on my master’s thesis? I really lost my drive after this happened :(

Thanks a lot ❤️",1
"Hello depressed folks of Reddit. So avoiding all the reasons I'm currently very depressed, just want to focus on one part of it, the title of this thread. Both my physical and mental health have absolutely gone downhill. Physical, I'm having gum problems, all sorts of internal problems. Mentally, well that's so far down the drain I'm in the ocean. Yet I almost subconsciously stop myself getting any help for any of it. I just can't do it. Even though I know I need to, and could just about afford to. There is a part of my brain that just refuses. I'm sure plenty of you have had the same thing.. but have any of you managed to get out of it? And if yes, how so?

I feel like a loser and a failure because of it and the envy I feel of everyone else is just eating me alive. I just want to find someone who will choose me.

"that’s probably the wrong way to word what i want to say. but all i want is for someone to ask. ask how i’m doing. ask if i’m okay. it’s always assumed of me to be the one to hold it all together.

even then it’d be reassuring to know that people notice i’m not okay. and i haven’t been for a long time. i’m scared to vent to anyone close to me and so it’s come to the point that i’ve resorted to venting on a post for strangers to see and judge me. not that i care much. i just need to get this out.

there’s going to end up being a series of these sorts of posts because i just can’t bring myself to tell anyone. and it’s selfish and babyish of me to hope for them to ask me if i’m okay if i act as though i am. but i’m not. and how the hell would they know? it’s stupid of me to be upset about something so simple and yet it’s all i want",1
"I wish I knew what I wanted for my future. I never saw myself living past 18 and now I’m here and I have no idea what I want. Anytime I make my parents mad they always threaten to kick me out or make me pay rent, but I don’t have a job. They discourage me having a job while in college. I don’t even know if I like college. I don’t know anymore. Anytime I try to tell them about my struggles they just say I’m lazy. I never do enough. My little sister is the golden child. I just wish they could see me. They don’t know I’ve been self harming since I was 17. I tried to tell them I was suicidal and they all started ridiculing me and saying stuff like “you wanna go join the crazies in the looney bin?” My little sister is the one they care more about. 

I decided to apply for this thing, I don’t wanna be specific. But I figured I’ll wait and if I don’t get accepted I will kill myself. And I think about being found by my family but it doesn’t make me upset. I don’t care if they find me because they’ll only care when I’m dead. I only have one friend, I’ve never met them but I wish I could. I love them. They would be the only person I’d miss. 

I have no friends irl. I thought life was supposed to be great in your 20’s. I would rather relive high school, and I had no friends then either. I can’t even be in a good mood without my family saying I’m acting weird and suspicious. I wish I could hug my family without them wanting to push me away. I really want a hug.

I wish I knew what my emotions were. I feel like I’m going crazy.",1
"Cannot sleep having insomnia, want to be happy again but you feel even more miserable the next day. Trying to sleep knowing you have a shitty job to do tomorrow. Eating junk food, masturbating smoking all that shit for short term relief.

"My moms birthday was Xmas eve. This will be the 8th Xmas without her. It will be the 4th without my dad and the 20th without my stepmom. I miss spending the holidays with them. I miss getting them stupid little gifts. I regret so much about my life. I married a woman who couldn’t have kids and although I love her to death I always wanted a kid or two. Adoption right? Yeah it’s not that easy. I know I probably sound like an ungrateful piece of shit and maybe I am. I don’t know. I think about suicide daily but there’s no need to use that report button I’m not going to do it. My best friend blew his brains out at 21 and I couldn’t hurt my wife like that. It’s just a rough time of the year and I feel so alone because since my dad died I’ve isolated myself from my “family”. I put that in quotes cause they (step brothers and sisters) never treated me like family. I was the bastard that broke up their perfect family 🤷🏻‍♂️ Anyhow I don’t know why I’m posting this, maybe I’m just hoping someone will say something nice to me or something to help. Pathetic huh?",1

My depression got me to the point where I let myself go, now I’m overweight so that’s not helping. I had no enamel on my teeth so I had to get them removed because they were just falling apart no matter how well I took care of them. So especially because of those things my self esteem is at an all time low. So at the age of 29 I feel like there’s no point to keep this constant fight up. I’m on a pharmacies worth of meds that I’m not even sure are working anymore. I’m an insomniac, and to top it all off I have a hard time trusting anyone because iv been stabbed in the back to many times to count. I don’t know I’m a mess.",1
"I was diagnosed with depression 7 years ago at 17 and never properly treated because of money issues and it was always sort of just an even depression level where I was still functional even if I didn’t thrive and sometimes I’d have spells of not even feeling my depression. Over the past six months I’ve just…fallen apart a bit. 

Combined with my adhd and chronic pain, which have their own issues, my depression has just bitch slapped me. I’m constantly miserable, my brain never shuts up about it, and makes me feel like I’m just being a baby about all this. I’m struggling to eat more than 1000, sometimes 700 calories a day because I lose track of time, or my sensory issues make it impossible to eat more than the same few things that I’ve exhausted myself out on. 

I’m fighting to get insurance so I can get…a therapist or something or any kind of help. Affirmations don’t do shit for me, and I’ve heard “try exercising” too many times. 

I just want to wake up one morning and no longer immediately want to cry or think about how much I hate myself and my life. I’d like to be able to just decide I need to eat and then eat something, not immediately have my mind screaming too many options at me and all of them taking too much energy. 

It’s so frustrating that if I can get insurance it’ll be a while before I can get an appointment, and if I need medication it’ll be even longer. 

It’s not that I want to die I’d just like to simply not exist anymore and be stuck in this fucking cycle day after day.",1
"All the sudden during our fourth session my therapist started to use the word “healing” for the first time. He’s trained in CBT and related therapies (ACT, DBT and other brief solution focused interventions) so I was a little surprised, but maybe that’s normal. He just started saying stuff like “healing is about….” And other stuff using the word heal and healing, also mentioned “forgiveness.” He also mentioned the word “schemas.” It was only our fourth session but we were doing traditional CBT stuff then suddenly I mentioned not feeling like a “full person” and feeling incapable of love or real love, that’s when he started to talk about healing. I have had some negative stuff in my past that he knows but I don’t think it counts as trauma.
But also I could be so off base. I know I should just ask him myself what he meant but I’m just curious if these are normal words CBT therapists use, or if it’s related to him being an addictions counselor (I don’t have a substance use disorder), or if it suggests we’ll be doing more “depth work.” I will ask him but in the meantime I’m curious what your experience is. Thank you.",1
"so 5 months ago i've made a huge mistake that cost me my friendships and i was at The lowest point of my life, i was so ready to end myself but i decided to get help by talking to one my closest friend. They were so supportive and understanding but at one point they said that i started to think that i dont care about them anymore bc all i've been talking is about the friends that left me and not about the friends that stayed so i stopped talking about it and thats pretty much it.

this morning however i just found out that they were talking shit behind my back and have been calling me a baby and an idiot bc of all that and now, i dont think i have friends anymore, i feel so lonely and im really considering suicide now

sorry if my english sucks",1

"Even though I'm only 24, it feels like there really isn't any reason to continue. I feel as if I've either pushed people away by just being miserable all the time, or the friendships I had were out of convenience.
And I know situations like these are getting more and more common, but I really don't know what to do, can't seem to have any luck finding jobs, or anything that gives me any sort of happiness.
But by far the worst part is the loneliness, I just don't feel as if I can take it anymore, I don't even know how to go about trying to make new friendships because I'm either too miserable to even try, or an anxious mess.
So I wanted to ask, does it get any easier? 
Because I honestly feel like I'm running out of time and options, I've stopped eating, sleeping and even leaving the house, it takes enough of my energy just to try and struggle through all the constant and terrible thoughts.
But anyway, If you've read this, thank you for your time, and hopefully you're having a better, happier time.",1

"This is pretty much just ""30 minus 2"" to me at this point; or, if I'm feeling PARTICULARLY pessimistic, ""40 minus 12.""

I haven't accomplished much in life. 16 to 25-year-olds have accomplished more - perhaps even MOST of them in that age group. Getting a driver's license; visiting a foreign country; getting married and starting a family; finishing college and getting into a great career - I've accomplished NONE of that. Hell, I've never even published or produced/released ANY of my music. Sure I have a few close friends and family that love and support me, but beyond what almost everyone else has and takes for granted, I have no support at large and feel like I'm invisible and, ultimately, forgettable. I've written a freaking symphony for God's sake! Where the fuck is the recognition for that? Why hasn't it been performed yet?

It's because I'm autistic, isn't it? I could literally be the SAME EXACT FUCKING PERSON - but NEUROTYPICAL instead of autistic - and none of this would be a fucking problem! Like, wtf?",1
"I have fought depression most of my life (in early 50s now). And usually when I spend time in this subreddit I am trying to encourage people - especially teenagers and young people- to look through the demon dog in their head and hang in there. It will get better, I have said often. You matter. You can do it. I care.

I think maybe the reason I cared so much to try and help anonymous people out here is because I knew that one day the dog would be back in my own head, and either I was trying to soak up good karma or trying to put words down I could look back on that would help me when it did.

It’s back, the dog is back in my head (when I envision depression it looks like a big, snarling, menacing black dog foaming at the mouth). And I’m afraid I don’t have enough left to fight it this time.

What’s wrong? Honestly, nothing. I have no reason to have had a mood set off. I just got a new job six weeks ago and it’s a big financial win; I left a toxic culture in my last company to find a supportive and friendly one where I am now. I’m married with no real relationship strains beyond the normal day to day stuff that every couple weathers and gets past every day. My kids don’t hate me, and they’re pretty successful and seem happy. Our finances are okay. Life is, generally, pretty good for me.

And yet, if I could go to sleep right now and never wake up again, I would thank God for understanding and crawl into bed.

All I can think is that if this thing comes back and grips me hard enough to choke me out even when life is going well… then it’s NEVER going to leave me alone and there is no hope of ever escaping it or feeling normal long enough to not be afraid that it’s waiting just around the corner.

I have no energy. I just want to stay in bed. I look at my preteen daughter and think only of how much better her life will be without me here; think of my older teen son and decide that I did my job and he’s grown now so it’s time he take on the world on his own and he doesn’t need me here anymore. All I want to do is cry until I go away for good.

All the words I tried to say to others that were hurting seem ridiculous and naive and useless now. Hang in there, it gets better? Like hell. Life is GOOD for me and I still want to be dead. You matter? Do I really, though? My new company would keep making money without me, the kids wouldn’t have my moodiness and short temper to deal with, my wife would be financially okay. Friendships feel pretty meaningless and superficial, doesn’t feel like my absence would hurt anyone all that much. Therapy helps? I have been in therapy on and off for 25 years, yet here I am. I feel like everything I have ever told some anonymous suffering person out here has been a lie, and that just adds to my guilt.

I just don’t have it in me to fight it anymore. I think it’s got me again and this time it wins. I have nothing left to give.",1
"19 F. Hello everyone. I want to start this off by saying that i am not trying to self pity here at all, I am just trying to figure out what is wrong with me, since this is the only place I can express myself. I read every single comment. Your feedback is very much appreciated, be it negative or positive.
Ever since I could remember, I have massive trouble making friendships that last long. The roots date back to my childhood when i first started making friends. As a kid, i dealt with abnormal amounts of bullying, both physically and verbally, as well as mentally. I often found myself chasing after friends that never seemed to really like me as much. I had a hard time saying no, and often would give off my toys and art supplies in hopes of them liking me more. As I grew older, around 4th grade, I shut off completely, my mood was down, I refused to leave my house or do pretty much anything. My parents despite their awful marriage, gave their all regarding stopping the bullying that kept reaccuring at school, but it didn't end until I began high school and moved away. I've noticed that few things have not changed at all. I still chase after people's attention and affection, i try my best to please them - when they don't give me the same energy back, i shut myself off. Both of the manipulative relationships I've been in were the absolute cherry on top of this shitfilled depression sundae. I thought a romantic partner would care, but they were here to fulfill their own needs and left me drained of any energy. I chase after older men because I am in a state of need for protection. I feel like the world is crushing down on me. My best friend, a person whom I've helped as much as I could and the only person I genuinely ever felt a connection with, left me for a new group of people and her boyfriend. Right now, I am ""in a long distance relationship"" with someone who rarely makes an effort to see me. He said he can't travel a lot (we're 45 mins apart) because he's financially struggling but I see him and his friends posting online together at cafés and clubs all the time. Another friend I have, doesn't even open my messages, and only contacts me once every three months to hang out, she says she's busy and unable to hang out, she promises she will be consistent more, but that just keeps me needy and on edge more. But again-keeps posting online with other people, on events she said I will be invited to, and as you can guess, I never am.
I live alone, I had to move because of family issues. As a witness of so much abuse in my life,I genuinely don't feel like I can continue my life like this. Everyone seems to use me, EVERYONE. I am extremely naive and vulnerable due to my constant state of loneliness, because I keep looking for what I'll never find with every new person that enters my life, and people use that constantly.Even when people are a tiny bit nice to me, I get teary eyed, its on a rare occasion that people seem to acknowledge i am here, a being with feelings and needs too. Suicidal thoughts have been on my mind 24/7, as well as guilt that I'll leave my mom in a constant state of pain if I go trough with this, but I genuinely feel like..nobody. I waste my money on pretty clothes and jewelery that I can't wear because I don't go out, the comforting feeling of having things feels nice, I guess? The only thing that entirely fullfills me is work, I am a freelance digital artist and graphic designer, but as of lately, I can't even do that, I'm so depressed I can't do anything besides sit and breathe. Nothing that I've loved doing fullfills me anymore. I've tried therapy, and it just made things worse....i feel like I'm judged, maybe its the doctor, or maybe its something else. I don't know. Please note that everything I said is just a summary, there are so many events and details that have occurred, but it would take days for me to tell them all.
Any thoughts would be appreciated, thank you for reading.",1

I don't want this, help me. No one to talk to, no one that could relate. It feels so goddamn bad.

I suffer now, push myself beyond what I can endure, just to get into a good school, so I can suffer and push myself there, so I can suffer and push myself to get a good job, so I can suffer and push myself to get paid. And that's it, that's all there is.

"Hi everyone, so basically what the title says. I’ve had a few things happen lately that made my depression much worst. My dad was in hospital, I found my cat dead in the road, I have a family member who has cancer, and more things as well. Im on a pretty high dose of Zoloft, 125 mg. But it wasn’t doing anything anymore. So I increased it to like 140 mg. I felt ok for a few days, a little better, then not so good. It’s been a few weeks and my depression is bad.

I cant help but be selfish, everytime someone talks about their problems and people comfort them i cant help but think that i deserve the praise more. I cant help but think their life is amazing and that they are over reacting, that they get so much attention when I deserve it NOT them. I try to rant but i end up repeating my words over and over again because thats just whats on my mind.

I have so much built up feelings and no matter how much i try to get it out, i cant. Im starting to doubt i even feel what i claim to feel. 

IM the one who deserves all the help. IM the one that deserves to have a good life. NOT others. its extremely selfish but i dont know what i feel anymore , when people ask for me to explain, i just cant. I want help without the thought of them helping me in mind",1

My job? A well paid job? Screw it. That is not making me happy. I wanna resign from it.

Was studying for the meat hard and what was their score? Where did they go for medical school? Where did they do their residency? Are they licensed to have a private practice? Where did they get their PhD?

I literally took the entire year to work on my mental health. I tried everything, I talked to two different psychiatrists, went to an IOP, half a dozen meds, therapy, took time off of going to school. Nothing is working.

"I don’t know who else has experienced this, but taking medication to treat this issue only led me to losing almost all of my close friends. 

It drained me of any energy that I used to have when it came to talking to people. This meant that I was finding it more and more bothersome to engage in conversation with people I cared about. As a result, it led to me unintentionally killing conversations and slowly but surely ghosting people.

I used to be a very empathetic person that would always encourage my friends to confide in me. But the medication did a 180 on my personality and now sometimes I wish I didn’t take it, even though it did help a bit.

I don't know how to stay content being alone. I push myself to get out there and be social which is how I have some really genuine best friends, but other than that group of small people I really don't have it in me to entertain conversations or talk to random people at parties.

"For the past few weeks and pretty much nightly, I've been having incidents/attempts. Obviously this means I'm in constant contact with the crisis team.

Sometimes they even ask why I'm calling if I've not taken any steps. Then I get told I'm ""letting them down"" when I do something anyway. 

Naturally I've also been around police a lot recently and while some were absolutely awful to me, a good deal were BETTER than the crisis team. That's a problem imo. 

I'll be discharged from the crisis team soon since they've organised some support, but in the meantime, how do I navigate them?

"Basically what the title says. This is the worst depression I’ve ever experienced before, and I’m not new to being depressed by any means. Life has just been so hard for.. my whole life really. I’m severely mentally ill and have a mental disability. Cps, doctors, and the school system completely failed me and I’m very behind in life. But especially these past 6 years have taken an extreme toll on me, but I was starting to finally get better. But the past month has dragged me into a hole I don’t see a way out of. I was in a relationship for the past 3 years. I had just quit my job to find a new one when he broke up with me and kicked me out, and essentially never spoke to me again besides giving me my things. And I feel like I lost everything important to me. I lost my best friend, my home, my pets, my job, my life that I spent years putting my effort and self into, and it’s just gone. I showed up a couple days later and some girls stuff was there, and my sex toys were spread all over the room. Whoever the girl was tried on some of my grandmothers clothing from the 60s that was very sentimental to me, and ripped it up beyond repair. I moved back in with my parents that day, back into that abusive situation, and 5 days later I was sexually assaulted by a family member. A few days after that I had a doctors visit and was diagnosed with a chronic pain disorder and chronic fatigue syndrome, and was told that they couldn’t do much to treat it. My whole life is falling apart. I can’t even describe the depression I’m in. I’ve been through complete hell before. I have felt grief, pain, and loss. But this is hurting so much worse and I don’t even know why. I’ve gotten rid of the idea that I’m suicidal over the past few years, I was always too afraid to die/the pain and reached out to anyone because I was crying out for help. I always said I didn’t have it in me to actually do it. This time feels different though and I don’t like that feeling, I don’t fear the idea of pain and I don’t want to reach out to anyone. I don’t really have any friends to talk to anyways, and my family thinks mental illness is a “mind over matter” thing. I don’t know what to do. Depression for me has always felt like sinking in stillwater, like I’m stuck in a daze or paralysis I can’t shake myself from. This time feels like ocean waves constantly crashing on top of me and I can’t get enough air.",1
"I haven't been in a relationship in 8 years and haven't done the horizontal tango in 5. Every time I think I'm getting somewhere with a guy, he ghosts me. I mean I'm not ugly, I am BBW. But someone has to like me. I am just so tired and want to sleep all day. I am so lonely I am wondering what the point of living is again.",1
"I have no idea how it all happened. I swear I was okay 4 months ago and suddenly I got thrown into this familiar dark pit again and the edge is too far for me to hold on to and pull myself up. I’ve been depressed before but I was okay for a bit and suddenly I’m not functioning anymore again. I feel like a floating nothing. I can’t feel my hands, my feet, my face, it feels as if I’m nothing but hollowness. I cry out of the blue for no apparent reason, I don’t know why I’m in pain, all I know is that everything hurts yet at the same time, I’m numb. And during this numbness I’ve been hurting myself again like how I used to and now it’s far easier to do, I don’t even hesitate, and that’s how I knew how bad it is already. I talk a lot but I say words that don’t make sense and I can’t seem to know what to say. I can’t explain how everything feels. I don’t know how to be okay because I don’t even know what’s wrong. I don’t know how to fix it because I can’t understand what the problem is. And I never needed sympathy, all I need is to be better. All I need is to feel a little less miserable. To feel that I haven’t lived the same day for the thousandth time already. To wake up for something and not just for the sake of not having another choice but to open my eyes. A little less pain, that’s all I ask. But God, you stood me up.",1
"I moved to this country not having any friends. Met coworkers along the way. Used to be friends with some of them but they have gotten married and I remain the single one. I feel like the only ones that want my company are the ones having relationship issues with their husbands. I’m a gay guy. They just like my company. Most days, I just like to stay home and enjoy myself. Right now I’m just listening to some music and browsing through. I go to casinos once in awhile but I’ve been avoiding that place. I don’t feel sad though. I’m okay like this. But some of the things I’ve read says I have symptoms of being depressed. For real? Lol! Anyhow, I’m just sharing my personal experience.",1

"I feel distant from anyone, feels like no one cares about me nor eachother besides my parents and the one who loves me, still i doubt about that. 
I dont have any sort of motivation or things that bring me joy ont the daily basis.
The only thing thats keeping me up is my patience and regret of making my loved ones sad, still im afraid of how long that the this chain of love will keep me hanged to life and unfortunately break. 
I would appreciate some interaction and advices, i think my main problem right now is college and being three consecutives years on the same grade without advancing in nothing since i left highshcool. And seeing that most of my friend's are advancing in life and im stranded in this mug hole makes me sad althoug i feel happy for them.
Help.",1
"I've dealt with depression myself. No self harm, just silently existing in this world. 

I thought about suicide, but coped by learning to embrace the time I spent alone, talking to a therapist, writing myself notes, and journaling. 

I've always been open about my struggles with the people I talk to, and I think it gives me the ability to relate with others going through similar experiences. People tend to share their experiences with me, and I am grateful I can be that person for others. 

Recently, I became friends with a seemingly happy, extroverted, life-loving guy. I honestly envied his life, all the happiness he exuded, and his ability to make friends that adored him. 

But one night, he felt comfortable enough with me to show me his wrist. I was totally in shock as I saw scars lined up on his wrist. Apparently, I am one of two people other than his family to know about this. Self harm is something I have not encountered myself nor have I met anyone that does this. His scars were healed and thus seem old, but I want to be there for him because I think he is still struggling. He says he really can't be alone, which is something I don't entirely understand because I prefer to be alone. 

How can I be there for him?",1

"Just a bit of rant here I am 25M, my mom died when I was 12, dad died when I was teen, no sibling. Had gf but she too left me coz of her family. I always hoped that a day will come when I will have my own family, a good job. I have always been optimistic that's how I survived this long but now I can't see any hope for future. I always feel too alone, I want to cry every single moment not a single person is there to listen to me. It feels sad that not a single person will care even if I live or die. I have some relatives and they are good too but they all have their own lives, I don't wanna be a burden on them. After my dad died I completed my schooling on my own, completed college on my own. When others of my age wanted to earn more money I just wanted a family, someone to call my own. I was jealous of them how they can talk to their mother or their sibling whenever they are feeling down but I always thought someday I will have a family. Now it seems impossible, I am just fed up and tired of life. But as a final chance I am giving myself one year, I don't have any hopes now but let's see if my life improves.",1

I’m going to have to sell my 2020 SUV &amp; buy a beater just so I can attempt to pay my bills, which I have no clue how I will do next month and may end up losing my home before I’m able to sell it next year",1
"Why addictions suck so much...? I just relapsed in self harm and watched some XXX videos to relax but now I feel guilty. But I wanna keep watching but I feel bad and disgusted at the same time. Wanna drink until I can't feel my body and get high on caffeine after that.

Why am I so emotionally dependant on people? Why does it hurt so much when I don't talk to the 3 people I care the most? Why am I so addicted to them too...? Why am I so toxic?

Why do I keep dreaming? Why do I have big goals? HOW can I become a doctor if I can't even deal with my own wounds? How am I gonna go to college if I can't even focus on school or basic chores? How can someone so selfish like me do what's considered to be the Lord's work?

Why do I wanna die so badly? Why can't I be satisfied with what I have? Why do I crave so much more? Why do I give up so easily...?

&amp;#x200B;

The worst? I know that this is probably just a moodswing and in 5 minutes I'll be just fine again. Sorry if I'm bothering anyone. Guess it's sometimes easier to listen to random people than listening to people you know already and you care for. Hahah...",1
"I’ve seen many psychiatrists and therapists but I have always answered “no” to the infamous question “have you been having thoughts of harming yourself or feelings of hopelessness”?

I am genuinely curious how therapists react to those who have answered yes to this question. I guess I’ve always assumed they would try to send me off on a grippy sock vacation if I admitted to being suicidal. 

How did your therapist/psychiatrist respond when you answered yes? What kind of medication or treatment did they give you, if any?",1
Everything just stays in my head. Everything I think about is negative and I can't go out of this repeated loop. I really need to talk to someone but no one is here for me. I live in pain.,1

My cars breaks weren't enough as we continued sliding down and smashed into his car and then another car proceeded to rear-ended me. The lady who hit me from behind gave me her name and number but left the scene and told cops and insurance she never hit me. I am being put at fault for all damage as it's a no-fault collision state so break checking isn't illegal and the lady isn't covering me for any damage on the back end of my car. I can't afford to repair it as I'm a college student and cant make it back campus before exams and I can't miss them or else ill tank my grade and not be able to get into the business program. lol, what should I do as my next exam is in about 48 hours across states, and Im stressed beyond belief with no help.",1
"In February 2020 I met a woman on Facebook and knew straight away she was the one I loved, sadly a few weeks later the world shut down and it is still impossible for us to meet. 

Not being able to work during lockdown and leaving my family home has ruined my financial situation and I’ve lost all motivation, although I do currently have a job.

It’s getting to the point that I don’t know if I can continue with this medication and I want off. But what are my options? Take myself off them slowly even though that can be dangerous? Go to a clinic and hope they will help me? Go to the hospital even though it’s not life or death? Wait it out? I just feel so helpless.

"I thought it would not be an issue for me anymore. It's okay to be alone since everyone is unique. But I still feel kinda down by night when I found myself absolutely isolated from the world, like staying in the room alone and having no visit no messages no notifications. 
I hate inner conflict but I always have to deal with it. I hate blowing hot and cold. I hate paradox.
Why is human being such a complex creature? I would never think so much if I were only a paramecium.
it's raining outside. It makes my fingers numb to text further.
I know there is no real friend actually existing in the world, like no second ""ME"". On the one hand, I enjoy the time to be with myself. I can find inner peace. I can create my own art. I can do anything I want in spite of the prejudice or harassment from the outside world. On the other hand, I still want to ""build"" contact with some of the ppl who I can at least share my feelings. 
It's hard to find such a person irl. It may have something with my personality to do. I'm kinda introvert. As a girl, I like gaming, anime and graphic design. I can do some modelling or motion graphics. I like to hear edm, hardcore and rock. I have no interest in Netflix or gossip. I'm not meaning any gender opposition here. Compared to most of the girls around me, it's rarely to find one sharing similar hobbies with me.
I can force myself to be social and hang out with other people, even it's just pretending to be gregarious. But it makes no sense if I have no interest in their topics. What can I then say except ""really? that's interesting"" However, if I don't do so, it may come to one day that I finally realize I already have no one to talk. 
Why are some artists/lonely person always seems to be depressed? They are too stick to their inside world and gradually lose the contact with the reality. The consequence of losing reality is nothing more than death. 
It's not a structured text. I just wrote everything in my mind. sry if there are grammar mistakes. It makes one even harder to find the belonging as a student st undying abroad alone. Anyway, thanks for reading my personal sh*t. Hope ur guys have a great day though.",1

I feel like i destroy everything i touch. I make my life so hard like i dont want to put effort for school and i dont eat healthy because i want a eating disorder and i dont even know why anymore. I just sit in my room and get burden in my own thoughts because i dont like myself and want to go back to those times which were good. I dont want anything from my life. I dont expect nothing to change. I cant think of any future where i could live happily anymore. I dont know if these are even real things to be sad about but i am done with everything.",1
"Hello :) 
Tbh I don't know what exactly is wrong with me..... 
But I'll try to say everything that bothers me.... 


I'm a girl and I'm 20
I was accepted in University 3 months ago. It's one of the best universities in my country. But I'm struggling with my lessons. My teachers expext me to be active in the class but I can't. I don't have the confident to talk. I never had. I always panic everytime I want to talk. So even when I know what to say... And I know the correct answer, I still remain silent. Well that means I would lose points and I hate so much. I keep comparing myself to the others...


Well about friends.
 It seems like they always fail to undrestand my feelings... I think It's my own fualt... I'm just too scared to show them my true self. Telling them my frustrations. If they tell me sth that mskes me sad... I'm even afraid to tell them that they hurted me by telling me thoes words. I'm scared to lose them.
I don't have anything interesting to tell them so sometimes I make up sth just so I can talk to them. I think I just have one friend that can atleast tell I' m sad.
I have online friends too. But It's been like we dont have anything to talk about. Not anymore. Just one of them and she doesn't answer my messages and she once dissaperaed for more than one month. Aside from being alone. I was so worried. I had her phone number but I was afraid to call her. I said what if she doesn't want to talk to me and I would make her angry by calling? After one month she ce back and simply said I didn't feel like to go to social media.... Well It's not like I can blame her... I, too hate social media sometimes but atleast saying she won't be online for a few weeks wouldn't hurt, would it?


I tried to warm up with my new classmates at University but after a few days I felt like I'm making myself look like a fool.


About family
It's me, my 8 years old brother and my parents.
I don't have the perfect relationship with my parents. Specially my father. Now that I'm thinking about it we barely talk and I started realizing it not a long time ago. But when I saw my friends and their father... Well that was when I undrestood it.
He is really bossy and gets angry really soon. And when he gets angry he says hurtful things. He used to hit me and now sometimes he hits my brother (you know...hitting your kids is pretty normal in my country... Middle east... )
He said hurtful things to everyone even my mom. In front of me. 

He is waaaaaaaaaay better than before. He goes hiking and mountain climbing (with his friends ofcourse) and since he started excercising his manners got so much better. But he is still far from perfect. 
My mother.... Well lets say she would have been a lot better if she wasn't my fathers wife. 
She has some on nerve manners yes. But I can say It's an effect from my fathers manner. 

But he made me like himself. Basically I'm the worst sister in the world. I bully my brother. It's not like I hate him. No I love him so much. But I hate that how much he looks like me as a child. He gets bullied by his friends and instead of helping him I just make him feel worse...
It's not like I never defended him. I told him to dont play with thoes bullies but he is so stubborn. I know his feelings... He doesn't want to be alone and do everything to not be. I know cause I was like this when I was a child. Just like him. 

When I was a child. I had my parents pressure on me for literally everything. Now he has my parents + me
I'm scared I'm turning him into a psyco just like how my parents did to me. 

I'm always on my phone. Not doing anything special. Playing games. Watching movies. Reading novels. Listening to music. Online classes. That's all. 
I'm into fiction so much. When I see a movie, a series or an anime I occupid myself with it too much. 
I also have the ugly hobby of hating who/which fandom loves a lot. That's why I started avoiding fandoms. So I wouldn't ruin my favorite things for myself. God knows how many characters and stories were ruined because of high impact of fandom on me. 


I hate myself so much.
I don't even know what is the purpose of me living. I didn't do anything usefull in my life and I doubt I ever would.

Sometimes I think.... I'm studying my favorite major... So what? Then what? I'll find a job? Buy a house? Buy a car? Then what? Is this what am I supposed to do for the rest of my life???


Can I be a better person? Can I stop worrying too much about fiction and start loving the real life?
Can I save my brother from our fucked up family?
I want to.
But I don't If I would ever be able to do so....


Thanks for listening to my bullshit. It took a lot of efforts to talk about it. As I said, I'm always afraid of talking about my frustrations....",1
it feels like i’ll never win over depression.,1
"Hi everyone. For my placement, I have been working as a researcher for a local politician in my community. For the first month, things had been going absolutely WONDERFUL! The constituency assistant that I report to had been giving me a lot of important tasks, and everyone told me how helpful my research has been. It was such a great feeling because it was the happiest I had ever been since my dad passed away in January. He was my best friend and the loss of him continues to hit very hard, especially since I was only 23 when he died. Up until I got my placement, I had very little hope for the future. However, these feelings changed when I became very successful in the work had been doing for my placement. I was even invited to attend a meeting with the politician himself, who thanked me for my research and told me that he would like to meet and chat with me soon.
After I met him though, the constituency assistant stopped giving me work. Even when I message her to ask if she needs anything, she will either not respond, or tell me that she doesn’t need anything. I went from doing so many things every day, to barely doing anything for over 3 weeks. This all happened after the politician complimented me on my work and said he wanted to meet with me.
I’m so down now. I feel like the C.A prevented me from growing and having a future at the placement. This was the happiest I had been in months and she took it all away. I really enjoyed the work too. My placement is ending soon and I doubt I will be able to meet with the politician because she isn’t giving me any more opportunities. I don’t have any motivation for anything right now. . I just want to lay in bed. Can anyone please send some nice or encouraging words for me to bring myself to work on my master’s thesis? I really lost my drive after this happened :(",1
"**Ps. This might be long so feel free to skip this post. I just want to let it all out and I've got nowhere else to go.**
&amp;#x200B;
I (18F) got diagnosed with clinical depression back in 2018 although I had started to feel it in 2017 when my dog died. I wont get into the details as to why I got depression cuz in fact even I'm not sure why. It was probably just genes mixed with a bunch of stuff that was happening in my life back then. &amp;#x200B;
But, only if I knew that depression would almost ruin my life. It has ruled my life, my decisions, my body, my thoughts, my emotions, my mind and basically all of me. It controls me and I feel like I have nothing left of my own (I'm sorry if what I'm saying doesnt make sense). &amp;#x200B;
I was never really a good student. I'd say I was just about average but at least I was a content back then. Now I'm just a stupid and dumb piece of shit. All I do is just lie around and rot. I feel like dying all the time even though I know that somewhere I really do wanna live. I'm always just so sad. The tiniest of things make me sad. I'm an emotional mess. I cant even look after myself. I dont exercise, I dont eat, I dont study. &amp;#x200B;
Currently I'm taking a gap year (I've graduated high school) and will be joining college next year but I dont study for my entrance exams. I have no desire, no goal, no dream, no motivation, no drive absolutely nothing. I dont even want to go to college. I dont know what I wanna do. I really just have nothing to live for except for my loved ones. &amp;#x200B;
I wanna learn how to play instruments and how to make art but i dont do anything. I'm lazy and I'm just on my phone all day long cuz I just dont feel like doing anything. My productivity is 0. There's just nothing. Or even if there is something, I'm too lazy to do it. I know i can fix my life and myself but I just dont wanna do anything. My mom begs me to exercise and eat yet I keep torturing her by not doing anything. Why cant I just do something? Why is everything so hard. I know that I wont clear my exams if I dont study yet I do absolutely nothing and waste my time. I'm wasting my whole life away. I've wasted 4 years of my life being depressed. I could've achieved so much and done so much for myself if it wasnt for depression. I am nothing but just a burden or a baggage on everyone. &amp;#x200B;
I am just so tired of feeling this way all the fricking time. My tears are literally on my keyboard while I'm typing all this. I know people want me to stay but why should I when nothing is getting better? People keep telling me how it will all be okay soon and I wont have to feel this way. When is 'soon'? When will the day come? I get these phases where i start doing better and I start feeling nice and happy and it starts giving me hope that I'm finally on my path to healing but I just keep falling back in this hole again and again and again. I cant even count the number of times I've hit the rock bottom. I'm so stupid for having this hope that I'll get better again someday. It just doesnt happen. Its a loop. No matter how hard i try, i keep failing and falling back in. I'm drained out. I just dont have it in me anymore. I want to kill myself but I cant because I dont want to give grief to those who love me. My mom has done so much for me, I cant even imagine putting her through that nightmare. Why cant i get better for my mom? I feel like at this point I'm just using depression to escape hardwork but I genuinely have no strength in me to do anything. I sleep all day. &amp;#x200B;
I am so dependent on everyone for my existence that i feel like I cant live without them. My entire world revolves around my loved ones and I'm the last person to do something for myself. I treat myself like shit. I dont take care of myself. I keep deteriorating all the fucking time. Fuck me. I cant see a way out of this. I've had enough and I'm going nowhere. I'm stuck cuz I dont want to live and I dont have the guts to die either. I dont want to live my entire life feeling like this. I am completely useless and I wont be surprised if I end up nowhere in my life unless I change. I wish I could turn my life around. I wish I could get rid of my depression and this constant sadness and what not. I'm pathetic and a lost cause.
&amp;#x200B;

"I’m spiraling out of control and I can’t stop I don’t belong anywhere and I fuck up every good thing that comes my way. I feel so alone and there’s nothing I can do or say to change what matters. I’m poison, I hurt everyone who gets close to me. I hurt the girl who I’m confident is my soulmate and the one who cares the most about me now she won’t talk to me and has me blocked. It’s all my fault and I never wanted it to be this way. I’d do anything to change it but there’s nothing I can do. I’ve been crying for 3 weeks in a row now and I can’t hold down work or even leave my room. I feel sick.

"I wanna cry but can't, tips?",1
I don’t know who I am at all and it’s really confusing. I can’t understand anything about myself and I don’t feel like I really have enough stuff to make me a person. Like if I was a character in a show I’d be massively underdeveloped and of no relevance at all lol.,1
"Basically I was/have been a miserable, toxic person to be around, and several people who I considered close friends basically have chosen to distance themselves from me because of it. I don’t blame them at all— I wouldn’t want to be around me right now— and Tbh I don’t want to hang out with them anymore either. Part of that is I’m just miserable almost 24/7 and I self-isolate to comfort myself, and part of that is spite, if I’m being honest. I logically understand their choice and respect it but it still hurts. 

I am working on myself, I’m in therapy and have been doing a lot of self-reflection, but I guess I’m just worried now. I always thought I was a good friend, or at least tried to be, but I haven’t been a good friend to them (and I didn’t realize at all how bad I’d gotten until someone said something), and that makes me afraid that maybe in future relationships I will continue to hurt people without knowing, or that I must deserve this for being a bad person, and the punishment is that I should be alone.",1

yeah thats basically it. it would mean a lot if you can answer,1
"I've been in a hospital for a month after suicide attempt, i'm not sure if i wanna do it or not. Met a girl only to fall in love with her, she gave me hope and then cheated on me with several people. I'm now drinking a lot and I'm constantly on stimulants. My heart is slowly falling apart but I really don't care. I loved once too much, I don't wanna die but I don't wanna live as well, so I just mix antidepressants with liquor. I now only think about two things, the girl that broke my heart and my friend who was really worried about me mixing meds with booze. I'm not sure should I share this with you but I'm just so fucking lonely, and constantly drunk and on drugs.",1
"I just kind of sit around most of the day and think about what a piece of garbage I am, I know I'm supposed to challenge these thoughts if I ever want to break free of this level of depression but they just won't stop.",1
"my entire life i've lived with shame and guilt. i'm not gonna go into detail as to why my life is horrible or why i feel the way i do. all i know is, it's not surprise i've been depressed my entire life. and probably why i will be depressed as it goes on. i am so sad. so freaking sad. i've had about one to two months of what i thought was fucking happiness but it was merely delusion disguised as hope. hope to live a good fucking life. hope to feel good, look good, talk good. i'm lonely. sad. poor. ignorant. stupid. im getting suicidal again. im so fuckin stupid. so fucking stupid to have thought i was getting better. that there was hope in this fucking life. i was born to live a terrible life. it's just what the fuckin universe wants for me. nobody cares. and nobody will ever care. im just gonna go sleep it off like i always do. just like my fucking mother slept off her life to wake up crying everyday to a god that doesn't fucking exist asking him why he is torturing her constantly while letting the bad guys live a happy merry life. fuck everything.",1
"I feel like garbage. Maybe my mind is exaggerating but I don't feel like I'm going to make it for too much longer. Or if so, I feel like I'll be disabled and a burden soon. I'm not counting on seeing my unborn kid grow up anymore. I'm just hoping I'll be alive to see them being born. Maybe I don't have the proper perspective. Surely there are people out there who have it worse, right? Of course. Doesn't change the fact that I feel this way.


I feel like a big stroke is imminent. I feel like my vision could be taken from me at any moment. I feel like I have so much to do but barely have the will to live right now. I really just want to crawl up into a ball and wait until the childs birth. From there, just let my body go.

I can't even think about the fact that my child will have my shitty genes. What if I pass it on and they start having troubles early in life? At least my bitch ass made it to my mid 30s until life started really and truly beating my ass. What if my child, because of my genes, doesn't make it that far?

 Fuck. I hate this life and I hate that I'm going to be such a burden. I hate that I'm such a failure. I'm a waste of potential. Someone else could have done a lot better with this body. Don't bring up stupid motivational shit like there is still time. I don't think there is. Time is up.

I failed over and over again. And no, I didn't get back up. I found a way to stay in failure.

I have nobody to blame but myself. Sure, I probably got these genes from my parents but they are doing okay because they took care of themselves. Instead, I stuffed my face with pizza 3-4 times a week and ate probably a couple thousand calories worth of sweets on most days. I knew I had HBP for years but was too dumb/scared to get it addressed, instead fucking it up further with supplements (K2). Permanent damage. No coming back from that.

I don't see a path out of this. But I can't end myself. I can't. I'd fail even more doing that. I can't do that to my wife and sisters and parents, as much as I don't want to live this life. They are the only reason I'm alive. I love them so much. I hate myself for disappointing them.

I'm struggling but I have no choice be to continue on. Fear is overwhelming me but I have no choice. My body is betraying me but I have no choice. I don't know what to do besides continuing on, even though I don't want to.",1
My copping mechanism was to help others ( my friends ) with their problems and depression but it doesn't work anymore it even hurts now and idk what to do,1
Something besides the usual motivational speeches. I want to know why I shouldn't give up. I want a reason to keep on living. Things ain't getting better. They ain't getting better at all.,1
"Hello all. This sounds crazy but I’ve found myself alone crying in my bed all day. Does anyone have advice or a similar situation?

My husband told me he is asexual and we have been living in a very long, lonely marriage. He doesn’t touch me, he takes drugs, and he doesn’t work while I have three jobs. A few years ago I introduced my ex boyfriend to a friend of mine. They would have never met had I not introduced them as one person lived in Paris and the other lived in LA. I am picking up my life now and moving my son and I into a crappy one bedroom apartment on the outskirts of town, and I am watching as these two are expecting their first born and just purchased a 3.2 million dollar home. I feel so unsettled and so upset. It’s like a car crash I can’t look away from. 

I don’t want a fancy apartment and I’ve never been superficial. But it hurts because I’m watching my life unfold as I watch another life (which I helped create) begin and it feels so unfair. This couple doesn’t speak to me anymore because the wife (my ex friend) found a letter the husband (my ex boyfriend) wrote to me right after they met, where he said that I was the prettiest woman he’s ever met. I can’t help but compare and watch what my life could have been

What do you suggest I do to continue living? I am just happy my son is having his nap so I could cry in bed for a few moments. 

Thank you",1
"i just kinda dont want to anymore. almost every job ive been at ive been touched by a manager. (ive only worked at three jobs). i just want to be treated like a fucking human. im not a meat bag. i dont want to get up anymore. i reported my manager to my GM and he said ""that's just how he jokes around."" I reported him to HR. you guys probably know how corporates HR is. my family says ""youre just a pretty girl, that's whats going to happen."" i cant anymore. ive had other managers tell me im over reacting and using my ""woman power"" to get something. i dont want anything but for it to fucking stop. i just want to be treated like a person. i want to die. i wake up only to go to work and be touched or called a whore or a tease because i dont welcome it. i thought turning 18 was supposed to be fun",1
"I started hallucinating well over a year ago, I have visual and auditory hallucinations of demons, angels, seeing faces and such. my voices told me to abstain from eating and i should trust them because it will help me with my healing
I discussed it with my family, nobody believed me and i didnt expect them to. some days later, i was invited to my uncles home and i accepted and went. my uncles wife
told me she wanted to help with my situation (shes a psychiatrist) and asked me to tell her everything and it will be confidential, so i did. and all the while all my family and relatives were harrassing me mentally (imagine i was already giong through so much) like shouting at me for not eating or locking me in the house.
one day i chose to listen to the voices and went outside and started praying for peoples well being, i went to the streets and just dragged my hand on walls and did my praying (as i heard from the voices), i went some 60-70 blocks doing that. no harm to anybody, just good intentions. late evening 2 people came and grabbed me by the hand searched me and dragged me like a criminal and took me to a mental hospital, it was so terrifying. i spent the next month in the psychiatric house. there they made a file for me and everything i told my family and relatives ( who said all these info will be confidential) they had made it into a file. they would interrogate me with silly questions trying to extract info out of me as if i would trust them with anything after the violence and threatening they used against me.
things lead to one another and i somehow got lucky (my father signed my release documents) and i got out. now again after 6 months my hallucinations are becoming more but i love my hallucinations they show me parts of me, my identity i want to study and learn them but again my mother is forcing and shoving pills up my mouth. I dont feeel my body is mine anymore or i have any free will at all. i just feel like a victim and really hurt and i have lost my faith in these people.
i know they wanna help but they have seriously damaged and hurt me.
why do they feel entitled to my body and consciousness, im a human being i never wished to be born at all but now that i am here, i should still live like a slave. i have lost my faith in humanity and i wish i can some day take revenge for the things they did to hurt them but i know it wouldnt help me at all. but these feelings hurt and are a burden and i honestly dont know how to help myself and i cant even trust anyone anymore... it hurts alot i cant even put it into words...
i sometimes wonder if they are mentally ill and im the sane person,,,",1
"School has stressed me so much to the point I cut myself. I’m honestly ashamed to admit it and I can’t get and mental help because it’s very rare in my country. I’m slowly getting sadder with each second I stay in the desk I sit in, sometimes I secretly cut during class. Each second I stay in school I think to harm myself more. But I just wanna ask if it’s common to be depressed because of school",1
"The ability to feel human connections has escaped me. This wasn’t always so. I used to be the kind of person who was the life of the party, who could have a conversation with almost anybody and even get “social highs”.

Well, now I view everyone as an antagonism. I have no excitement or thrill of getting to know people. I don’t even feel like I have a personality or an identity anymore , just sort of a lifeless breathing thing. 

My husband says “it’s easy to make friends - people are everywhere!” but what if you lost so much of who you are, socializing begins to feel more like a chore for you than anything else ? It does not feel natural . I feel an imaginary wall between myself and people . I’ve been depressed long enough to stop pretending and I know that makes me appear occasionally more awkward or “cold” but I just don’t know anymore.

I’m 27 years old- am I suppose to live the rest of my life without any friends? In a way, I don’t even think I could have them as empty and ghostly as I feel- it seems pointless.",1

I need someone to talk to…",1
"My family wants to move out of province. I’m in my early 20s, and still am dependent on them because working at a minimum wage job had never done anything but make me wish I wasn’t such a pussy and could just blow my brains out. I have dropped out of college twice, both times I was studying something I thought I loved. My parents paid. I do not want to leave my hometown and leave behind what shreds of a life I maintain. I told my family this, and they don’t care. “So get a job and move out” but I can’t. I can’t. “So come move with us.” Also not a promising alternative. No degree, no friends, no drivers license, no money, living with my aging parents in the middle of no where. 
I’m starting to think that I just was not destined to be alive. I asked my father why I was born, and he said “your mother wanted a baby”. Did they not have the foresight to realize I wouldn’t be a baby forever ? YOU wanted a baby, and now I have to suffer for what, 80 years ? And for what. 
This is all so pointless. I thought getting more and more pets would give me reason to stick around, but I resent them too now. 
I wish someone would have warned me about the world, or at least prepared me in ANY WAY. 
I wish they just wore a fucking rubber.",1
"I’m such a failure in so many ways and I don’t know how to pick myself up. It feels that when things are improving, it only gets worse again and it’s an exhausting cycle.

I have nothing to offer the world",1

Lately I just want something to trigger my emotions so I can let it all out. I’m craving the after feeling of balling my eyes out for hours however I haven’t been able to cry for a while.

Idk if my depression has just gotten worse but I go in these phases where my head will hurt then I’m just confused and feel miserable.,1

I stayed in bed today.

My mum got angry because I didn’t do the chores she asked me to. She said she’s sick of me being ‘in a mood’. She knows I’m depressed, I don’t understand why she just won’t help me. She’s just ignoring the fact that I’m not coping and then getting angry because I’m not getting better. I wanna get help and call the doctors but I’m too scared because last time I did I messed up the prescriptions had a panic attack and my mum laughed at me, I’m all alone in this, what can I do?

It could literally be anything ( like certain concepts , etc)",1
"This year has put a lot of things into perspective for me. Including family dynamics, issues, and more. I’ve decided to leave home, so that I won’t be anyone’s problem anymore, I won’t be the superhero people confide in, I won’t be the witness to pain and trauma and arguments that never needed to happen, or have to pick sides on people I love. I guess in a more poetic way I am exiling myself, because I’m sad everyday. And I’ve been wanting to disappear for a very long time now, both for forever and awhile. The weight I’ve been forced to carry isn’t fair and maybe I am a fool for thinking things will change if I leave. Along with the escape, it’s way of saying sorry for the things I have done too. The only way I know how to show how sorry I am is to leave, and I’ve debated which type of “leave”. 
I’m not going no contact but I’m becoming unavailable. It’s a little lonely. But I should be used to that by now",1

*No! Because you're gonna be addicted to this and you'll only get desensitized so there's no point!*

Oh! I finally feel these techniques are helping me

*But this is only step one, this might not work next time, plus, what about all the other times similar things haven't worked? This won't work, and ur gonna have to face shit every day just to fucking heal.*

Maybe I should be nice to myself and give myself a treat or something!

*No! You're going to be a sugar addict! We've done this before! You shouldn't need ANY substances to be happy. Just be happy with NOTHING then we succeeded.*

I could ask others for emotional support and to help love myself.

*No! FUCK NO! YOU'RE RELYING ON OTHERS FOR ATTENTION!! WE MUST SUCCEED ONLY LOVING OURSELVES ALONE! YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TOBE HAPPY IF THAT HAPPINESS CAME FROM OTHERS APPROVING YOU!*

I could release my anger right now!

*Then we'll never get to the problem! It's a bad coping mechanism! Learn to sit with EVERY emotion. You don't wanna be a JERK do you?*

Like fuck...I just want this to stop...I try so hard to accept everything, but like I said, this voice always thinks about the future, and stops the healing. I JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT I CAN DO THIS AND THAT IT'S NOT ALWAYS ABOUT THE FUTURE!! Mindfulness can help, but even then, this voice overrides whenever I *finally* feel happy! Whenever I finally feel good in the present! FUCK FUCK FUCK",1

Last night because my apartment had been dark more since I am bad about turning lights on while focused on the computer (finding a job, and it is getting dark at like 5pm) and going to bed earlier (8 instead of 12, depressed) they checked in to make sure things were okay.

"I'm a guy and 23. I've analyzed myself and I really think a big reason for my depression is that despite repeated efforts over many years to find a girlfriend I've had only lots of rejections. You might say I don't need a girlfriend to be happy, and that may be true, but that doesn't change the fact that no one of the opposite gender was interested enough in me to at least give me a chance. I just wish I was asked at least once by a girl something that showed genuine interest, like ""hey, what are you passionate about?"". It's like if you were told dozens of times over the years ""bro you are fucking stupid"", you'd most likely believe it. This also made me sexually frustrated to the point I no longer watch porn or masturbate so this is not something I can solve by hiring a ... professional. I think it would only make me more depressed because it would be a reminder that there wasn't anyone that wanted to have sex with me as a result of mutual attraction.",1

I just wanted to see if there’s any other poor soul out there that experienced the same thing. The worse my depression gets, the more I can feel it in my brain so to speak. Some days I wake up and feel sort of a black fog in my head. Other days it felt like a burning, or stinging pain is there. Now it just feels like there’s something gnawing at my brain. Don’t worry, I know I sound delusional but I can literally feel these sensations and it’s driving me absolutely insane. These things are becoming as prominent as the depression itself.

The fact I made it to 21 is an achievement in its self and I'm proud of myself for making it this far, but I mentally and physically can not do it any more.

They don't rise up, just descend
I don't care anymore
I've lost the will to want more
I'm not afraid, not at all
I watch them all as they fall
But I remember
When we were young” Idk who’s the “we” referring to but the torment of my depression is always knowing I wasn’t always like this ; it’s the ability to gauge deep into the past and remember a time where I felt real that hurts me the most because where the fuck did that go and why does it seem so irretrievable to feel real again?

I keep thinking about how I went to college to get a bachelors degree and all I got is a lousy job at target and I’m constantly thinking that I’m a disappointment to my family, especially my aunt who was my co-signer for my student loans. I have a friend who is about to graduate with her masters and entry level for her is $60,000 a year and I’m super happy for her. I love that she’s going to be doing what she has wanted to since she was a kid but I can’t help but be jealous that she’s getting to be able to do what her degree is for while I’m just working a retail job. I feel like shit for thinking this way but I just can’t help it. I am trying to get interviews for jobs that I would want to do with my degree but it just brings me down more and more I think about this and the longer I go without a message back from these job offers. It’s like a huge spiral and I’m just so tired of being this sad and disappointed in myself.",1
"Some context, I've past my worst phase of depression, until the next one that is. I can somewhat function on a day to day job with some side effect. Suicidal thought rarely popped in.

Lately I'm noticing whenever I go about my day, I'd look at things then starting to imagine how that could be my last moment. Some super simple things as well such as get on a car, crossing the road, stand on a balcony, sitting in my kitchen, etc. 

Deep down I still don't want to exists I supposed. Is this behavior common? Should I be more concern?",1

"Shouting into the void again. Hi. 

TW: mentions of suicide

I’ve been trying to get therapy for over a year now. My mom only finally decided to help me when she saw how bad I was really doing, and not just trusting me the first time I told her I needed help.

Then I had a meeting for it and she had to be right next to me so when they asked me if I had suicidal thoughts or wanted to hurt myself or others I had to say no otherwise Mom would flip out on me.

Now months later I haven’t heard anything from them probably because they don’t think I need immediate help when in fact I’m tempted to off myself every single day.

I tried to reach out to my counselors at my school but they were all “busy” so I just cried in the waiting area in front of everyone while they ignored me. One lady came up to me and started talking and immediately got distracted by someone else talking about posters. Then she left and didn’t come back even though she said she would. I cried the whole period in front of everyone and no one gave a flying fuck.

I just feel like no one really cares. No one gives a shit about me or my declining mental health. And for the first time ever I really actively try to reach out and want help so badly I just get shut down again and again and again.",1
"depression feels like falling off a cliff, falling into the water and not being able to find the shoreline. it feels like you are sucked into a lake full of sadness, worry, heartbreak, and insecurity. your body feels weaker and weaker by the day. you have no motivation. however, there are hundreds of thousands of people who are still swimming in that same lake trying to find the shore. you are not alone. look hard, find that boat, that will help you get to the shore of happiness. it may not happen overnight but it will. i promise you it will. i will always be that boat for everyone who is struggling to swim back to the shore. you will find your happiness someday. everything will be okay",1
"While Covid restrictions are happening I will save as much money as possible so that when the borders open up, I’ll take a year off to go backpacking around the world. When I’m done I’ll find a nice place to pass. I can’t imagine life getting any better than that.

Life is so hard that I can’t deal with it anymore. There’s so much to worry about with our generation that’s beyond our control.

For example:

Jobs don’t pay enough for us to buy houses. It’s hard to raise a family on a single income when that’s what our parents/grandparents did. What went so wrong that we now barely scrape by on our own. If It’s hard on my own, imagine what it’s like having kids.

Social media is turning us into self absorbed people. We’re constantly comparing, one upping and judging. 
We’re an insecure society. It’s like If we don’t have a following who the fuck are we.

Work, work, work, until we die. When do I get to enjoy life? I want to live a slow and simple life but still be able to afford decent shelter, warmth and food.

It’s just hard. 

So I’m using my last year on this earth to enjoy a slow life. I will see beautiful places, eat different food, meet and make wonderful friends. Then I’ll find a beautiful place to spend my last days. 
I can’t imagine life getting any better after that.

Are the things these people shows me what life actually should have been like if my life were normal? It bloody scares me, because it feels so unfair that I got these cards on my hand. The sad part is that the experiences that life have given me living with depression/anxiety have driven me far away from everyone. I can pretend I fit in for a short moment, but it takes a tremendous effort for me to even keep the minimum positive attitude over time. And after I am pretty much drained for days.

Happy moments are always so short. We get a job, we buy a house or something like that. The happiness is so so short because we get accustomed to it quickly. 

Sad moments such as debt, death or just anything even distress with social interactions. 

My examples aren't as great but what I meant was happiness is fleeting and short. Sadness is long lasting until it's solved, almost engraved into us for time. 


Living life just for those short happy moments aren't worth the sad moments that also come in life. I also want to consider neutrality coupled with sadness as well as we're just existing, aging with time but nothing benefitting us.

"Someone once told me they wanted to go to therapy to be seen. To be looked at by someone who’s job is to deal with broken people, and told “well crap, you’re messed up.” We all want to be that messed up, and in a way that’s the reason none of us feel seen. We’re all so blind, so caught in our own dilemmas and challenges, we forget to look over at the guy next to us and say “man, I could not handle your problems.”

Most of us are faced with the challenge of feeling seen, it’s human nature to want that. Some people go so far they entirely stop seeing themselves. Maybe that’s because some part of them feels sorry for anyone who has to feel unseen so they have no energy left in seeing themselves, maybe that’s because it scares them to see their own bumps and bruises, maybe it’s a psychological problem not easily explained by words, you could ask them and they likely wouldn’t be able to give you a solid answer.

Some of these people no matter how broken feel so selfish seeing themselves when everyone else needs to be seen too, that they likely won’t be seen much in their lifetimes. Everyone who takes the time to see them gets pushed away, because other people could be seen so why waste time on them? These people can’t trust anyone to see themselves, because they can’t even trust themselves to see them.

I keep coming across the Japanese practice of Kintsugi. Where you take a broken bowl, and use a gold adhesive to glue/piece it back together. It’s supposed to show that cracks and breaks are special and beautiful, unique and precious. A an esteemed famous personele said “I don't fix these. I wanna remember these dents forever.” (Tow Mater 2006) because the bruises are what show the character, loveability, and progression of any particular person.

I had a friend who did a drumline show regarding the Kintsugi. They built back a large broken bowl by the end of their show. The peculiar part to me is that every member got to take a piece of the bowl home for keepsakes. Kinda poetic, you are both broken, but also necessary for the whole. Society is full of broken people, who want to be seen or heard, who’ve hurt or been hurt, all creating a beautiful community and civilisation. That civilisation wouldn’t be as beautiful, ornate, or pure without each I individual person.

The cool thing about Kintsugi is that you can do it any number of times. Though sometimes it won’t hold as well, you can keep doing it as much as needed, creating a beautiful, unique, one of a kind bowl.

The problem with being broken is that you can’t carry anyone else’s problems in your bowl, at least not like you used to. So you have to fix it back up, at least to a passable standard. Hopefully letting the gold dry. Though that’s the problem with those who feel selfish seeing themselves, or looking at their own bowl, once they see it’s fixed, they go on to look for other broken people. They won’t ever truly get fixed because their bowl keeps breaking again and again, usually before the glue sets, without anyone batting an eye. How could they, everyone’s eyes are closed to it.

Sometimes people have hit rock bottom so far you could fill their hole with the entirety of a lake. And so these people who can’t see themselves try their hardest, scooping out the lake on some of the worst cases, trying to bring these people back. Their bowls can only hold that much water for so long, and so they need help, with is great!

However what happens to those who have lakes, and won’t let anyone or themselves scoop the water out? What do they do? Nobody has shown that they truly want to help, everyone has left after a few bowlfuls was too much. Maybe they just can’t be fixed they tell themselves, maybe they can’t wait for the glue to dry because what’s the point? They’re so deep in their lakes the Mariana’s Trench looks like a Barbee dream house pool, there isn’t any fixing them. You couldn’t get any amount of people in the world to drain the ocean, no matter how much you pay them.

So these people keep breaking, as they just scoop more peoples problems into their own ocean of filth. Soon these bowls no longer have any of the original pieces. They’ve become solid gold. Luckily for them you can’t sell your bowl, only a fool would roll dough to take a stroll through your null troll black hole of a soul.

It may seem great to be full gold! King Midus thought the same. However the full gold souls of the world would beg to disagree. They’ve become so alienated by the richness of their gold, no longer understandable to those with parts of the original bowl showing. And most importantly they’ve lost themselves

The thing is after so much gold, you lose every bit of your past self. Those who still have remnants of the original bowl couldn’t understand the feeling of truly being lost, and having no idea who you are or what you want to do.

Some of these full gold bowl fools still haven’t let it dry, their whole bowl is malleable and misshapen as they never took the time to let it fix, they just don’t know how. Only when the bowl breaks for good do people see them. People see a dead, unusable bowl, but in every moment before it they were nowhere to be found. 

The sad thing is, it isn’t at fault of the people who didn’t look, or the people who couldn’t stop looking at their own bowls, or even the ones who tried to scoop some water out and gave up after a bit. It’s the fault of the bowls owner, for they didn’t know how to allow people to take some of their water. The sad thing is, that’s part of the reason they had so much water, part of the reason they broke so easily. Because every time they had to take a second to scoop out some of their own water, they hated themselves more for it. And everytime they did that, their bowl cracked a little more.",1

"Existing just feels like a chore.
I have zero motivation to do most anything anymore, including getting out of bed most days. I haven’t tried writing everything down in a while so I guess I’ll just start airing out all my shit and hopefully I feel some kind of satisfaction. But now I’ve been staring at this post for 4 hours, I’m on a fucking throwaway on an anonymous forum created to post this kind of shit and I still can’t hype myself up to post it. Congrats to me if you can see this I guess. 

I’m just completely exhausted and burnt out, tired all day but wide awake anytime past sunset, on really bad nights I will lay in bed unable to stop thinking and crying about everything until the sun comes up. I’ve done multiple sleep schedule rotations. Everyday is starting to blur together because of it, I haven’t been able to keep track of things easily. Its getting harder and harder to socialize with people. My thoughts move so fast I can’t speak properly anymore, I stumble over my words on a constant basis and I have trouble trying to get my point across because I lose track of what I’m saying. I’ve just saved myself the hassle of trying and have just been using the one word answer approach for the most part. 

I’ve stopped brushing my teeth regularly, showering regularly, and shaving regularly. I don’t really get hungry often, but when i do it’s difficult to keep food down. I haven’t gotten a haircut since my mom peeled me out of bed for errands a month or two ago. I don’t want to do anything or go anywhere. I suppose it’s not uncommon for people to have not gone out and about for the past few years but it still feels especially heavy on me, since this is how I’ve been living even pre-pandemic.

I find no joy in most of the things I used to like. My gaming pc burnt out the other week but even before it broke I just spent most of my time bankstanding on runescape or scrolling around YouTube because I can’t really think of anything better to do.

I’m doing online classes solely to make my dad happy, every time I open the class I try to buckle down and do something but I am completely disinterested and blow it off, which is making my grades plummet. I already failed out of university, this is a community college that I’m at now and I just can’t do it. I despise school and I feel like it’s just ruined me, higher learning is a massive scam but I’m being conned into doing it anyway because I need to be a full time student in order to get health insurance benefits.

My friends seem uneasy around me now, I only have 4 friends that I see regularly now, over the past 4 years I’ve seen the number of people I consider in my circle get lower and lower and it really sucks seeing people who you thought were homies dump you to the curb. It’s most likely the fact I made no effort to reach out or anything and just let most of them drift away.

I completely lock up and shut down when I’m around my parents, there’s some days where I can talk normally but most days I just feel either extremely irritable at speaking or too fatigued to answer, both options end up shutting them out of conversation with me or being as robotic as I can to try and not work myself up too much.

My dad has been constantly checking on me and I feel like it’s because he’s worried I’ve committed suicide. I feel terrible because he’s admitted to me he’s lost sleep over seeing me so defeated. I’m sure my mom feels the same way, she asks about how I’m feeling constantly and I usually have to shrug her off because I don’t think either of them have a grasp on how to deal with me. I hate the burden I’m putting on and it’s taking a toll on the both of them. I can definitely see a difference when my siblings come home vs when I’m here alone.

I have a nicely set up support system and I’m just straight up rejecting it for no concrete reason. At the same time it’s extremely embarrassing and I don’t want to publicly admit to everyone that I am extremely depressed because I don’t think they will handle it properly and I will end up worse off in the end.

My girlfriend moved away to work for an entire year so I have been trying to work long distance with her but it is really taxing. A 6 hour time zone difference plus the fact she is working with kids all day means it’s usually around 11:30 or 12 at night for me when I even get speak to her. On top of this, recently she’s been doing a bunch of things that really really irrationally annoy me, which I know is not good foresight for the future. This is making me extremely upset because before she left I was set to marry, now she’s doing things completely out of character and does not seem like the same person at all. She’s only been gone for 3 months. I’ve tried to tell her that I feel upset without her and I don’t really want to do anything until she gets back, she replied that what I’m saying makes her really sad that she decided to move and leave me high and dry so now I feel guilty. I haven’t spoken with her about how I’m feeling for the past month because of it. It’s really hard to talk to her like a normal person anymore because I’m stepping on eggshells trying to avoid making her worry over me. She seems extremely happy there and I really don’t want to be a mood killer because I insisted she go since it’s her dream to live there, and probably won’t get the opportunity again.

I can literally see people are starting to write me off. My cousin’s wedding was a bed of hot coals for me, I had to keep (unsuccessfully) explaining what I’m planning on doing in the near future, only to receive a patronizing “wow man that sounds great, keep it up”, then have them 180 over to my siblings and being really excited when hearing what’s going on with them. I don’t mind being the black sheep, it’s just hard when you recognize that everyone is starting to lose faith.

I’m constantly being haunted by everything I did wrong in life and I’m completely unable to distract myself from it anymore. I zone out of conversation or work often and I’ve recently noticed my TTM is flaring up again while I’m not paying attention. 

I just want someone to tell me what I’m suffering from, I’ve been to therapy 3 times now and none of them are “capable of diagnosis”, which yeah I get they can’t legally do without a doctorate, but I just want something in the ballpark I can try and work with.

It seems like some devastating event is about to happen to me and I’ve been preemptively bracing myself for months for something that might not even happen. But as soon as I let my guard down I know something bad will happen.

I’m so tired of disappointing everyone important in my life and not having any sort of desire to do anything to solve it. I shouldn’t feel like this all the time, I’ve had a thankfully relatively privileged upbringing and I constantly question the validity of why I’m depressed. There shouldn’t be any logical reason I’m getting shit on by my own brain because everything was set up for me and if I just calmed down for 10 seconds I wouldn’t have crashed and burned so hard. I have no desire to die or kill myself at all, I just want to be “wonderful lifed” and no one will have to worry about it. I feel like I’m sabotaging myself and I can’t do anything to stop it.

idk why i feel this way. perhaps it’s the fact that i’m in school full time and work so i’m constantly drained. maybe it’s because i don’t feel like i’m gonna be good enough in my chosen field. or maybe it’s because yet another guy has lead me on and being 31, i feel like i’m gonna die alone. perhaps it’s just my needle (medication) wearing off and warning me that i need another dose. 

idk. but i feel so incredibly depressed and empty and even coffee isn’t helping. i thought i’d just post, maybe not necessarily for advice or anything but to get it off my chest.",1
"I have intense and vivid visualizations of killing myself or killing my husband. This happens as many times as multiple times a day or as little as once a week, depending on my anxiety and depression levels. I also suffer from intrusive thoughts ocd. 

Usually it’s just the thoughts. But sometimes I feel this urge in my body, in my veins, that I need to exert my energy to hurt myself and sometimes I am spontaneous and will try to hurt myself. 

I’m just so tired of falling in and out of deep depression and fighting myself to stay alive. If that makes sense?

How does SI present itself to you? How do you keep going?",1
"I’ve gone through a lot of trauma over my life, and up until this year, I thought I was bigger than it because it never bothered me, but it all hit in this huge wave. I was prescribed medication, which didn’t help really anything, and I’ve had THOSE thoughts often. I’ve been staying with a friend because I don’t trust myself being alone. I have 0 motivation and feel sick and exhausted almost around the clock. Where do I go from here? I just feel... Lost almost? I feel as if there is no way back up",1
"So, I'm 28, haven't been dealt the best hand in life, and have been trying to improve, that said I am faced with a particular problem that's been eating at me. I don't have family, I got my brother and one cousin and that's about it. My parents were addicts, my dad's dead and my mom is, well kinda a child. I have to coddle her with my words when talking to her so she's not really a parent in the sense of someone I can rely on or go to for advice. My financial situation is the equivalent to a first-generation immigrant, and the money I do make is just enough to survive even with 2 jobs. I took up school to try and get better and doing well so far it's just a lot of work and not a lot of free time for myself. It's hard to stay motivated with no support around me, I have friends but to be honest I can't and don't really want to share these things. I'd rather just have the few good moments I can with my free time. I just feel lost and alone and I am having trouble staying motivated or really just believing in some good for myself. The weight feels unsurmountable, I'm looking for a therapist again but finding a good one is a difficult process so I been procrastinating a little bit. How do you go on when you have nothing? Man not having/losing my family made me realize how important family really is and it sucks I don't have that to lean on. I just dont know what I can do, maybe I need a perspective change or something, maybe someone is going through something similar? It's like an existential dread.",1

"go to school then work, then marriage (most ppl’s choice ), and have kids. Are these the things we want to do from the bottom of our hearts?as for me they are not my things damn.I feel kidnapped and rapped by the life like I have to follow the sort of life routine.I really want to get rid of it but I know I can’t cuz I’m a coward.",1
"My mum saw the cuts on my thigh. I was wearing pyjama shorts, and she came into my room unannounced. She only saw a glimpse, but demanded to look closer. I refused, and she started asking questions.

What the fuck should I do???",1

"Hi I need help. I literally feel nothing. I don't enjoy other people's company and I have really bad anxiety. Like if someone gets to close to me I get anxious,but when I don't have anything to do I feel empty, like I just lay on the couch and stare at the TV wishing I felt something which then gives me more anxiety because I'm doing nothing. Does anyone else have this or deal with this? If so what has helped you? Did ssri's help you? I do workout out atheast 3 times a week and I have a job.",1
"I will first try to explain my current situation then I will somewhat attempt to some up my life circumstances that led me to where I am.
Sorry if my post is going to potentially be all over the place, I don't have the mental energy to write things properly and my thoughts are constantly wandering with me experiencing several emotion changes as I'm thinking in my head.
So to try to some things up.
I finally got a decent job where I make somewhat okay money (around $50,000). This job requires me to walk 15-20 miles a day and is based on commission. The thing is my knees are completely shot. Lately they have been feeling extremely creaky. This job is based on commission and relies on me to wake up early, beating traffic and having a fast pace.
The thing is I don't think my knees can last, potentially another year if I'm lucky. When I went to the doctor when I was 23 (6 years ago) they said I have the knees of a 60 year old who's done hard labor their whole life, this is based on x-ray scan. The thing is I've had other jobs, mostly entry level grunt work and I've always ended up leaving because I either couldn't handle being around a bunch of toxic masculinity and or it was a dead end job and there is no future there. Now I will attempt to sum up my life circumstances that lead me to where I am.
For the record I am 29 years old
I have the body of a 65 year old man who worked strenuous labor from a young age, during a time where safety was non-existent and is going to retire any day.
I have the brain of a declining 80 year old when it comes to cognition (memory, energy, motivation etc)
I have the life experience of a 13 year old. I had literally zero guidance or positive role models for my entire life and everyone thinks that I'm incompetent and or brain damaged.
My parents are Eastern European immigrants to America and I grew up in a household where a childs position was at the bottom of the hierarchy. A kid is considered stupid and should listen to the parents closely and that was it. There was no developing a personality, expressing thoughts or how your day went was non-existent and if you were perceived to be out of line in anyway you would get beatings daily, often several times. I remember the police would be called because the neighbors would hear screaming and pleading etc and the cops would show up and we would have to hide and pretend that we weren't home. The cops would have a very calm tone and be extremely submissive and just say that they were called because of noise and tell them to keep it down. This garbage household caused me to struggle In school. I could never focus and my anxiety was through the roof nearly 24/7. I was mentally, emotionally and socially hindered thus causing me to get bullied. My parents split and my mom moves us to an even shittier neighborhood. She would constantly work and be gone till late at night and my dad would come around on weekends to do his beatings if my mom complained of us not doing something like listening to her etc Anyways, as I got older I gravitated towards the bad kids in school. I wanted to be around people who I perceived to be strong, because strong people don't get beatings nonstop. Ended up getting into drugs and heavy drinking. From 12 years old I was stealing beer, skipped school, smoked weed etc. By 9th grade I already dropped out and was doing hard drugs and drinking daily, definitely was an alcoholic. When I didn't have booze my anxiety would be much worse then it was (if you can believe that). My mom who also had poor taste in men and grew up in communist Europe etc ended up dating a new guy. This guy would convince them to get married and he would end up trying to get me out of the house and divorcing my mom and threaten to leave me and her homeless. I would go to punching holes in walls to assaulting her new husband several times. I went to juvy half a dozen times for holes in walls and beating him up. The police that I had to deal with also were pricks. I will say this, most police from my experience have ZERO empathy and they provoke people just so they can put them in jail and earn their quota. Most cops grow up in good households and they judge others and treat them like garbage. The Last time I was in the back of a police car the cop who arrested me said that he would beat my ass if he had to deal with me again. I wish I was more educated, I would have turned him in to the FBI. I am honestly amazed that I didn't get killed by the police as a teenager, they take domestic violence calls extremely serious. That prick also let my stepdad punch me in the face when I was handcuffed and extremely drunk. He ended up getting promoted and becoming a detective and more. Corrupt fucks.
Anyways one day I would find the police at my house and my mom in the back of a squad car. He had gotten her arrested. I walked in and he asked the cop for protection and he started packing his stuff. If I wouldn't have been a minor I surely would have been homeless. She gets out of jail and I eventually end up going to rehab for a couple months.
I would workout with the buff guys who had been to prison etc. I worked out for 3 Year's and that's all I did. I don't know what happened maybe bad lifting form or tight calves, shit genetics etc but I would end up fucking my knees up by the time I am 21. I would end up stop having to workout because of knee pains. I should add that I would end up making a friend at the gym, for the first time a good influence in my life. Little did I know he was a lawyer, he just graduated law school and was trying to get me to study and work with him. He said that I reminded him of himself, Because he saw my gym determination. Little did he know that we have nothing in common besides both being Ashkenazi. Anyways one day I would tell him my situation and he would shun me from that point on and not talk to me anymore. Smart move of him, lawyers don't socialize with low lives it's against their code. In his eyes I quickly went from being his little brother to possibly in the future being one of his clients. It was then I realized that I fucked myself by messing up my record and knew going back to school was hopeless. I would then struggle with drugs on and off got the next 8 years. I would get some entry level job and would either be really agitated at coworkers and their toxic masculinity or I would lose hope because it was dead end. I would quit and not work for half a year then work again then quit etc. I go on Lexapro and antidepressant and end up holding a job for 4 months but would eventually start doing heroin (I left out that my brother around the time was a heroin addict) because I felt hopeless. Anyways the heroin had me become a full on junkie and I would then be on the streets for over 2 years shooting up etc. This last run I did really damaged me. Before I would be able to bounce back and it would be no problem, now I for sure did permanent damage to myself.
Anyways I would end up getting clean at the end of 2019 and would go to rehab, live in transitional housing and get this job I currently have. It was a men and childrens home so a toddler lived there. I would eventually end up moving out because I would be depressed because I would re-realize how garbage my childhood was in comparison to that kids. Anyways so here I am now. Still working the same job. Everyday blows because I have pessimistic thoughts 24/7. My mind constantly wanders and I am the master of finding reasons as to why I should just quit. I also have another issue. I have dozens of judgements or beliefs that keep me from progressing. Topics such as marriage, relationships, having kids, having a career, buying a house etc I have negative connotations about.
Since I never had anyone to challenge my thoughts or beliefs I never grew past them.
For instance when it comes to marriage I think it's hopeless because of massive infidelity. Partner count is directly correlated with divorce rates. Divorce means single parents and single parent households are a factory for creating burdens on society. Statistically most criminals grew up in 1 parent homes .
When it comes to buying a home I believe it's hopeless. I'm 24/7 obsessing about how in the generations before they could buy a house in full in 2-10 years whereas I would have enough cash to buy a home when I'm going to retire.
When it comes to careers I think it's hopeless because of inflation. Someone from the 1970s making average wage would translate to What I make now but the cost of food, gas, rent etc is 4x as much. Everything is going up in price and I feel there's no point and the best thing to do is not play the game. I think of it as image Africa, there is a farmer trying to make a living, he ends up joining the rest of the population instead because he cannot compare with the free stuff other countries give. I feel the same way. I would almost rather stop working and live in government funded housing and be on welfare then be lower middle class and barely scraping by and all the taxes to my check. I get taxed literally 33% of my paychecks and only get $500 back tax season.
I feel like relationships are pointless because of excessive partner count and microchimerism etc. Anyways I don't know what to do. My memory is garbage, my thoughts are always wandering, my motivation is zilch and I'm halfway handicap.",1
"Hi I'm Brandon I'm 30 years old and I struggle with thoughts of suicide and depression. I'm not even really sure what to say or what to explain I'm just. I'm struggling. My girlfriend for the last year and I have been struggling because of my depression. I don't know how to open up, if we get into any sort of argument I just shut down and start having tons of negative thoughts on the situation but can't say a thing because I'm afraid ill just make it worse. Its taking a toll on her and this morning she told me she feels like she's giving up on trying to help at this point. I told her I want to feel like she wants to help so if I say nothing when she asks what's on my mind I don't want her to just say okay and walk away but she told me she isn't gonna play those games. Its not a game to me though, I feel unwanted, I feel like every fight is my fault and that things would just be better if I was gone from everyone's life. I've already pushed my friends away, rarely ever talk to them on social media, I haven't seen any of my friends in almost a year, I'm not even sure some of them even consider me a friend anymore since I've basically disappeared. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm going to lose my gf because I can't open up and she is done trying.. I tried therapy, and they helped me come up with some breathing exercises when I'm feeling depressed or getting suicidal thoughts but thats all they did. Even the therapist didn't try to dig further. If they ask me is there anything I want to talk about I say no because I don't know how to say the things on my mind. After my last session like that almost four weeks ago my therapist basically said well I don't need therapy if there's nothing wrong to talk about and basically said no more sessions but they're there if I need them. Its like everyone is giving up on me even the person paid to figure out my problems so why should I keep trying myself. I don't know what to do but I'm pushing my girlfriend away and feel like I'm spiraling to a point that I will be alone for good.",1
"Anybody else live every day with just a low level of purpose? Like, I’ve got a solid (but very stressful) job, husband is a high paying ad executive, we own two homes, have three pets we love very much, we both go to therapy…on the surface, everything is all put together.
But every day, I come home from work and I’m just…bored. But at the same time, I don’t want to do anything. I’m struggling to enjoy things most days and feel like I’ve got nothing to look forward to.
I think back to when I was feeling more satisfied with my life, and what I did then, and what my life was like. I’d come home from work and read or watch Food Network while I got dinner ready. I’d grade some papers (I’m an English teacher) and not be filled with visceral rage about bringing work home. Sometimes, I’d go for a long run. I’d hang out with my cats. Now, I have no motivation to cook dinner, I can’t get into a book on work nights because I’m too emotionally exhausted… ughhhhhhh!
Anybody have tips for getting through this? Or just commiseration?",1
"I’ll try and keep this relatively short. I (21F) admitted myself to a psych ward on the 23/10 for 9 days (they discharged me lol). 

I was a risk to myself through suicidal ideation and self harm (nearly 2.5 months clean!!!!). 

I’ve been told by two separate doctors that I have functioning depression at around 17, though I suspect I’ve had it since I was around 12ish. I didn’t go on medication for it. 

When I was 19, I was assaulted and was diagnosed with PTSD and that’s where the self harm started. I was put on sertraline and it helped greatly but I suppose I didn’t realise that it wasn’t working anymore in recent months which lead me to having a breakdown. 

In the ward, they increased my medication to 150mg and it felt brilliant. They did some screenings with me. The doctor on the ward thought I had CPTSD but the psychologist disagreed and suspected a personality disorder of some sort, based on what I’ve told him. 

The psychologist came to the conclusion of Depressive Personality Disorder (amongst other things, but that’s irrelevant). I’ve been trying to find the difference between depression (which I have) and DPD but I can’t really find a difference other than depression can come and go and DPD is ingrained into your personality. Sources say the symptoms are slightly different but I can’t really find a difference?! It just sounds like depression??? 

Any help would be greatly appreciated!!",1
"I cant take this shit anymore. The constant suicidal thoughts are overwhelming.
I also get these daydreams/daymares/visions when im walking, running, sitting down, even when someone is talking to me sometimes. In these daydreams I would commit suicide and then I would feel my soul being sucked back into my body after its done. The crazy thing is that it feels like I was out for a few minutes but in reality it has only been a few seconds. And during this time, if i am running for example, my body would go into autopilot and keep on running while my soul gets transported to some cinema in hell.
Dissociation is also getting stronger as the days go by. I am constantly asking myself if I am in a dream and if something that happened earlier really did happen (it did but im still having these stupid thoughts). People are starting to become more and more like robots and it feels like im in a dream and I need to somehow wake myself up.
Its also gotten to the point where if Im alone and im not occupying my mind with something like playing a game, I will have a mental breakdown where I will giggle uncontrollably, hyperventilate and cry.
Whenever I try to think positive or try to do something to maybe make life a bit better it just feels like im trying to break open a reinforced steel blast door with a plastic fork.
I want to live a happy life but what I want more is for this shit to end quickly. As far as I know, no drug or therapy can make my situation considerably better in a short time. Which means that suicide is the only option.
Does anyone have any advice? Anything would be greatly appreciated 😀",1
"so things for my have been going down hill for a while, and it’s like right now i’m rolling down the hill really fast and i’m nearly at the bottom. 
yes in person i may look happy, but really i’m the opposite and i can’t seem to get any help. 
i feel so empty but at the same time so heavy and full. i’ve been self harming a lot more recently, it’s been a lot worse to the other night i cut pretty bad on my ankle there was lots of blood like lots i had to cut a sock up to put it on my ankle for pressure to stop the bleeding it was okay the next day but very painful. my parents don’t know about this and i hope they never find out. 
last night i almost od but didn’t obviously because i’m writing this. i feel if i’m not here anymore life for other would be fine without me like they will get over my death. i have 2 friends. i have been friends with 1 for 4 year now i think, but they have other friends and will be moving to a new school soon and i think they will make alot of friends and won’t really need me anymore. 
the other friend is 2 years older then me and i have been friends with them for a few months now and they are a great friend but they have so much stuff going on in there life they will probably forget about me soon. 
i haven’t been in school for 3 months now and only 1 person has asked why i haven’t been in school so i bet no one will notice if i’m not alive anymore. 

i told one friend i’m not okay mentally now and they just said “oh i’m sorry to hear that”, i was just like oh. 

and i told the other friend that i hated being at my house and need to leave for a night or 2 and they just left me on delivered so….

"No Online friends to play, No IRL friends to talk to. The only time I get to have fun, I lack in studying and fear, anxiety ruins it, I don't see a reason to live, don't know if i will be successful in the future, I'm still young but this isn't fun",1
"Not 100% sure which sub to post this on but hopefully this is appropriate. I (29F) have had 6 proper relationships in my adult years plus a few flings. I used to get incredibly attached to whoever I was seeing, and the thought of being alone was awful. The majority of these encounters resulted in me getting my heart broken, and I'd usually gravitate towards a rebound every time as soon as I could. My last proper relationship ended at the start of this year, and was probably the most painful ending (for reasons including lack of commitment from my partner as well as my mental health (depression, anxiety)), leaving me in a depressed state for months. It took me a while to get over it, and I've noticed over the last year I've become more and more cold and cynical. I don't feel sad at all anymore, in fact I don't think I've felt sad for months. 

I usually love going out/hanging out with friends, but I've found myself distancing and isolating from everyone - I legitimately want to be alone and I think I enjoy it but I'm not sure if I'm just used to it (combination of pandemic lockdowns and voluntary isolating). I've recognised this and have been putting in more effort to do things/see friends but I find myself completely exhausted every time and can't wait to get back home. I get overwhelmed by negative thoughts about those around me, and I don't at all think I'm better than them, but I just can't wait to get away from them. That being said, I'm not acting out in anyway - I don't think any of the people I've hung out with would've noticed a difference in personality when I'm around them.

I started seeing someone a few months ago who seems very into me, and I was into them at the beginning but this downward spiral I've tried to explain above just keeps going and I don't know how to get out of it. I can see myself breaking this person's heart soon because it's exhausting talking to/seeing them, but it's not just them, it's everyone. The only reason I mention this is because it is very unusual for me as I usually get so attached in romantic relationships, as I mentioned in the first paragraph. I've also found myself completely disinterested in sex, which again, is very out of the ordinary for me considering I've been single for so little of my adult life and have always been pretty sexually active. I don't think it's just that I'm not attracted to this person anymore, I've lost interest in all things sex including masturbating.

I have put off seeing my psych for a while because I guess I didn't think I felt sad anymore, but I know the way I'm going is ultimately going to leave me friendless. I've booked in but it's still 2 weeks away, and I've also tried googling what's going on but I'm struggling to find out ways to tackle this issue. Any advice would be great.

TLDR - After a big break up/depressed state I've not felt sad and am becoming more and more disinterested in being around people.",1
You complaining about everything I do doesn't make me want to do things. I already feel like a burden and you saying everything that I already hate about myself doesn't help. You always complain and you never say anything nice unless I force it out of you. I just want my mom back before I was diagnosed with depression. I'm sorry I'm such a burden but bitching and moaning about everything i do unprovoked wont make me get up and clean my room it just makes me want to burrow deeper into the covers. I just dont want to be lazy anymore and because of that laziness she's not taking me to a party which will be the only human interaction ive had in a year.,1
"Context that I've been feeling mostly down for years but only recently did my therapist explicitly call it depression. 

One thing I've been struggling with is having good moments immediately (like within an hour) ruined by bad things happening. Sometimes it's me finally feeling in control of work then seeing a message about a hiccup in a different project and having it ruin my mood. Sometimes it's having a good time with friends then falling apart after seeing a bad headline or hearing difficult family news. 

I've timed it, and rarely does a good mood last more than two days. I know part of it is me reacting to these situations in a way, another part of me is trying to see it as what it is (self-sabotage), but while I don't think I'm special enough for the powers that be to hate me, sometimes it also feels like really bad luck that I can't control.

Thoughts? Tips to deal?",1

"Hi all, I wanted to ask some questions about my recent experiences and hopefully clarify if I should be seeking more experienced help or not.

First of all -thank you- for taking the time to read this and offer support in anyway that you can. Even just acknowledging this is hard for everyone, and I’m not sure how else to thank faceless internet peoples — so just thanks.

I’m not young anymore, but I’m not old by today’s standards of excellence — but I’ve been in the midst of what I suppose could be described as a mid-life crisis for sometime now.
Without getting too explicitly detailed I’ll give you some background:
I’m a single father of one, I still live in the same city I was born in, and I’ve been in several serious relationships in my life, but married &amp; divorced once each to show for it.

Now, I have always felt like I’m weird. Just peculiar is the best way to put it.
I overthink everything, and always have as long as I can remember. The best description I can give is that if I walk into a store looking for item X, and they don’t have it/out of stock, I’ll be more likely to buy something else I completely don’t send to avoid looking weird/off/suspicious than to politely recuse myself and shop elsewhere.
I have spent an inordinate amount of time considering that ‘everyone is looking at me’, when I understand in reality that others simply couldn’t give a rats ass about my existence. Let alone me, just others in general.

It sounds dire and nihilistic but I think humanity just doesn’t give a fuck about humanity in general anymore, if it ever really did.
That said — I understand I’m a speck of dust in the ethereal wind, and my existence (and by extension this post) don’t really matter.

But if I’m aware of that, and yet I press forward biologically — eating when hungry, drinking water when thirsty, et al. — why am I unable to suppress the mental side of the coin? I’m unhappy. I’ve been unhappy for a long time.
I go through the motions every single day - but for what?
I’m 99.97% sure when we die we become food for something else, and the cycle continues to oblivion. I’m not religious, I’m hardly spiritual.
So why continue? Why work? Why pay bills? I’m not happy. I havnt been happy.
I wasn’t happy speaking to a therapist, it made me feel gross, off-putting to listen to myself complain about my life when others are starving, dying of rape or murder, grappling with their very existence… and here I complain from a warm bed in a house I don’t own, running water and food quite literally within arms reach…

I recently ceased taking my medications.
I was prescribed Paxil &amp; Wellbutrin years ago, but during Pandemic lockdowns and pharmacy issues I lapsed on one and eventually was changed to another medication by another provider, Zoloft.
None of these made me feel noticeably different, not that I can outright recall.
I do understand SSRIs are supposed to not be really noticeable enough to ‘put your finger on’ but I just never ‘felt better’ at any point. It felt like misdirection. No one solved my depression, they just got me to look at something else instead.

I’ve managed to alienate all my friends I used to have, now I spend every day and night alone wondering how I faltered so hard.

Can anyone offer a new outlook? I’m just so so so so so lost here.

Thanks again.",1
"Moments ago, i broke down in front of my mother. I was eating and when she came near me, i just hugged her and let go of my tears. Told her how I'm struggling with out thesis and my fear of not graduating. Then i went back to my eating. Finished my meal crying. Then i called my friends. Some picked up. Some didn't.

"I’ve been anxious and depressed most of my life. 20 years of therapy and medications. Nothing ever getting better, only worse.
My dad and I had a strained relationship and it was distant, and my mom has had her own depression but not at all like mine.
My mom and I are very close. She has done and does so much for me. Since negative thoughts are the first to come to our minds, I constantly have waves of resentment for her not looking into alternative treatments for me.
She has done SO much for me, going to many of my appointments, feeding me, comforting me, but really failed me in “letting” me spend at least a decade in deep depression on the couch, and a decade more in bed, immovable, without her seeking out different, alternative treatments that are helping me now- because I was finally able to help myself and look into them. I haven’t lived. And she’s very sorry. We’ve talked about it a lot and she lets me express my feelings of disappointment. She’s cried and I can tell she’s in pain about it. But months go by and I’m okay, and then sometimes I get really sad and feel very negatively towards her when I think of truly the decades lost and the pain I experienced that was emotionally addressed, but not practically addressed. What we did wasn’t working, and I think she was unable to do more, but I still have resentment sometimes.
Also, I get that it’s unfair that I only resent that my mom didn’t do more, I should hold my dad to the same thing. It’s the fact that we’re close and that I depend on her so much, it’s distressing that she couldn’t do something else so important.
When I’ve asked her why she didn’t look into more options, she says it was because she was just trying to get through to the next day. But for so long?? Also, I know she probably wanted to trust the doctors I was seeing.",1

I find myself alone, having heart palpitations, and on 3hrs sleep feeling like I deserve all of this when i did nothing wrong. When I did reach out to friends, everybody was so busy with their lives, that I decided I didn’t wanna ask anybody who already has shit on their plate. I didn’t wanna ask my girlfriend, because she asked for sometime to herself tonight and I didn’t wanna bother her. I didn’t ask my parents, because they had friends over and I didn’t wanna bother them. Why do I choose to do this myself? Knowing that if I just spoke up, people would do anything to help. Is it just me that does this? 

^*I am looking for help to stop doing this, but I mainly needed to do this to take this weight off my shoulders, and allow me to breathe easier.",1
"Ive been having suicidal thoughts and feeling hopeless for the past week. Ive been inconsolable and zombie-like in my home, so my family thinks im pathetic like im just eating, shitting and sleeping.

Today my mom fucking came into my room crying and started complaining about me to my fucking face that the family tries to cheer me up, but its my fault for giving them such a hard time doing so. And the whole time she was complaining i was feeling so mad at her like cant you see im having a hard time? And i cant even talk to her properly because she doesnt know what depression is or believes it exist, so i thought i'd save myself the effort of trying to explain.

I really really want to off myself. If this is life, then i dont want it.",1
"Hi I'm sad and don't really have any friends and I have tried meeting some online but it never works out and all guys just like messaging girls with no effort.

I hate the weekends. All my parents do is argue with each other and I like being at school where I can be alone and away from them. Hearing them makes me so sad and I hate it and nothing is even fun anymore idk what else to say I'm sad",1
"Personally speaking, both my mother and I are in the same miserably depressed boat together. It can be helpful from the standpoint that we can manage to understand each other so well, and what it is we're going through, but at the same time it can also be unbelievably awful since neither of us are in a position to help each other, or ourselves, which leads to a strong sense of guilt, insofar as we both feel we're letting each other down. You can't offer the support the other person needs, and vice versa, they can't offer the support you need. On top of this, two people stuck in a depressed hole together just tends to lead to this atmosphere of absolute hopelessness forming, where nothing can change or ever get better. This, in turn, leads to each person subtly bringing the other down, even if they don't realize they're doing it. Being honest, I feel like I'm the one most guilty of this. My mother and I have been trapped this way for at least 10 years now, and there's no sign it's ever going to end. I've often wondered if it would be easier to live alone, but that would probably just bring its own kind of challenges. It's impossible for me either way, since I'm agoraphobic and can't afford to live on my own. I've also spent too long living with someone I'm close with to really cope with an existence being completely alone.",1
"It is saturday today. I have been up since 9 and its 12 now. Im still in my bed, looking at my mess of a room. The attic of my dads rental home. I am 31 and ive been all over the place. I realise I have been stuck trying to find social happiness. I recently joined football again, old classmates from elementary school. Like this group friends from my hometown.

Before that I smoked weed. Spent money unwisely on stupid electronics I realise I never wanted.

I escaped my sadness and loneliness by gaming, smoking and locking myself away. Basically blaming all around me. My ex. My parents divorce. Me estranging from families. Being a mess with women after my ex, cant seem to appealing after thinking ""this is it"".

I have a mirror now, and i shouldnt compare, of guys who have a car. A house. A wife. A kid. Money to spend. While I have literally nothing to offer.


My job, which was a start to a better life, 2 years ago isnt extending my contract. With a bicycle im limited.
I was just starting as a football coach, playing myself. Develop a strong social life outside my games.

I feel, and I know, im that high school failure kid that u see at a reunion. I basically have the reunion weekly allthough its really nice to be able to fall into a crowd of mature and fun friends. But they have lives. I dont.
I have been in different social groups and I have done this in real life and online aswell.

Years of games with wasting money.

I have been running from reality for years. And still. I am typing this. On reddit. Tears in my eyes and sobbing so hard over my own self pity and feeling so bad for myself. While it is all my own doing.

I keep going back to the past in my mind. Seeing all the choices that have led me to this period in time. To the person I am today.

I keep working on being in good shape. Reality? I just want someone that looks at me and says. ""Damn"".
Because I have developed such low confidence because of the years of being single.

The fucked up part is I have led so many lives. Its hard to write it all out since this post is already all over the place and long. So many people I met. So many laughs I shares. Everybody followed a gameplan and is somewhere.

Im nowhere. I have led my life as if it was all for fun.
Now. I have jack shit. I keep saying this for years anr years. But now my well paying job is going away and i feel completely empty and hopeless.

I miss a girl in my life but I have nothing to offer.
Wanna chill and watch movies. Do things. Life my life instead of slaving away 5 years until im 36 and have maybe my first home, appartment for rent and have this ""this is probably some weird story behind thisn guy""


Fuck weed. I love it but its my coping mechanism.
Fuck games. Love em but they ruined me socially.
Fuck money. I need it to be free, but i cant fucking be mature and smart, until today.

Im so mad at myself.

Been to therapy. Been to psych, know my past and whats wrong. I just feel so cold in this.
 Gotta stop writing. Wish someone would just hold me.

Take care, hope it teaches someone to flip your life.",1
"I've been having a hard time for about three years now. I started feeling stressed and anxious. Then the loss of energy started. I went to a doctor and eventually had a mental health assessment. They felt it was stress at the time. 

Currently I feel anxious and empty. I have trouble sleeping with really vivid dreams. Sometimes I feel like I can't concentrate along with some fatigue. I'm not sure what's going on at this point. I've tried reducing stress, spending time in nature, exercise, diet changes etc. I'm not wanting to self diagnose, but something seems off. I have no idea what caused this. I never experienced anything like this before. I still work and keep busy which helps.",1
"It's been so long that I just completely forgot. I'm not saying feeling happy, but rather *being* happy, going to bed without wishing not to wake up tomorrow, being alone with my thoughts and not immediately recur to suicidal thoughts or be stormed with all my problems, or just living an entire day without wanting to be someone else, somewhere else.

I don't think I'll ever be happy again.",1
"These days its like i hate how i look and have extremely low confidence but i also don’t try or have the energy to try.

My piercings for me always made me feel beautiful but then i got made fun of for it and told i looked stupid by conservative family so i took it out and told myself it was my choice but it wasn’t.

Idk why but i put my earrings back in and unflipped my septum horseshoe and changed it to a ring. And i plan on putting my rings back on.

Jewelry made me feel beautiful and i took pride in my collection but I think I forgot that. And i took i all off

So yea idk if jewelry or clothing or makeup or dying your hair make you feel good then try not to let your depression keep you from continuing to experiment with those things

Just gotta keep with the small feel good things because I’ve stopped doing so much stuff i love and idk really why I stopped i just suddenly didn’t feel like it and just felt like sleeping all day. Which sleeping all day isn’t a hobby lol and doesn’t make me feel beautiful or good about myself",1
My parents see something might be wrong about my behaviour (Im usually a bit more edgy when Im feeling down) but all they ask is what is wrong with the attitude of what's wrong with you and whenever I try to talk about my depression with them all I hear is do this do that when all I really want is for them to listen and maybe a hug every once in a while without me asking for it. The fact that my parents are strict aswell just makes it 10x worse all I want is to get supported without the do this do that attitude.,1
"Hi I'm new to reddit. I'm 19, soon to be 20. I was first diagnosed with childhood depression when i was 15. Ever since then i have been on and off of medications and treatment. I'm currently seeing a psychiatrist and getting treatment. But he is still treating me with depression and anxiety disorder. It’s been about 8 months since I'm on many prescriptions. But i don't think it’s helping me. I'm still depressed. I constantly get suicidal ideation. My Mental state isn’t improving. I feel like it’s getting worse.
I did some research on my symptoms. I know self diagnosis or even looking these up aren’t good for my treatment, or so i have been told. But the first time i was diagnosed i insisted my parents to take me to a psychiatrist as my health was getting worse(physical and mental). Also Mental health is a taboo in my country. And my parents don't even believe in this. My sibling also has clinical depression and anxiety and he also got treatment (after me. He is older).
So, i think i have more than just depression and anxiety. Maybe adhd or bpd. I often think i have autism. I don’t feel whole. I always feel like there is a void in my life that i can't fill. I'm at the peak of my worst mental health. It is affecting my life very very badly. 
As i said I'm new to this platform. So excuse my mistakes if i made any. I don’t wanna disrespect anyone. I just don't wanna feel this way. I wanna feel ""normal"". Or at least know what is ""wrong"" with me.",1
"Did you ever burst into tears seeing people genuinely happy,in real life or maybe on Instagram.They just look so happy to me.My med school exams ended today and everyone seems so happy,and I'm like what next?Exams are a good escape from thinking about life and now I'm back to crying.",1
"Why couldn't I just have been a normal human, with an average girlfriend, average job, no mental issues, average family, average friends, average life. Ffs I would take below average even.

I wish existence never even existed. I won't even mention all the shit OCD/anxiety makes me worry about. Can't even enjoy a single fucking second. I'm ugly as fuckn fuck. And I'm not one of those annoying ppl who aren't ugly but claim it.

Idk man.. it pains me but I really don't wanna live much longer.. no point tbh.. I've faced so much pain in my life that I question if it would really hurt that much at all to stab myself 2 death. If I do, it won't even matter. Nothing matters. I'm tired of suffering. All that work i put info myself didn't do shit. I'm still a ugly depressed suicidal virgin. I hate living. I would hate quitting too but God damn man I just wish I wasn't born",1
That wasn't me. I can't imagine how I was ever able to get out of bed and go to work. How was I able to have friends and be fun? A couple years ago it wasn't uncommon for me to have a 3 hour conversation with a friend or banter with a group over drinks or participate in dance classes. Now that all sounds scary and exhausting. The person I was two years ago isn't real. It feels like a dream. The contrast in personality is just so different.,1

The anxiety of ""what if something goes wrong?"" Ive also been dissociating allot. theres just allot of things i cannot put into words. im just mess.

Well there were two or 3 people that came up to me indivdually at a different time this year that recgonized me but i never recgonized them. i need help man. i feel like i have nothing to lose but i need to just get out there to set my priorties straight. thank you to whoever read this whole mess.",1
"TW: suicidal thoughts, addiction
6 months ago I had a good life. Not perfect by any means, but I was in college, I had a summer job, an amazing girlfriend and just generally enjoyed my life. Looking back it feels like pure bliss. But it was all a thin veil over my destructive addiction. I got to a point where I wasn’t careful anymore about if anyone found back, and my girlfriend found out one summer afternoon. The shock and pain and horror on her face is something that will stick with me forever. Somehow she didn’t break up with me right then, but she did urge me to get therapy help. Maybe therapy did help a little but I already think everything through a million times in my head and I’m not super into talking about all of it twice a week. But regardless my mental state began to rapidly decline. It’s funny how easily we can rationalize and lie to ourselves about our problems, but as soon as someone else knows that facade just comes crashing down. That was the first time I thought about suicide. I had plans, but no real intent to follow through, but for the first time in my life it felt enticing and that definitely scared me. Most days that summer I struggled to get out of bed for work, and generally stayed to myself as much as I could. But this fall when I got back to college I thought things would finally turn around, being so close to friends and on campus activities. But really the opposite happened and I got so overwhelmed that I essentially stopped eating (losing 12 pounds in 3 weeks), and stopped going to class and doing work. I gave up and hoped it would get better in the future with no end in sight. A week into doing nothing I started having suicidal thoughts again, but these were worse. I had a plan, and a somewhat solid intent to follow through, but the night I would have done it my girlfriend asked me what was wrong and she held me as I sobbed for more than an hour and she walked me in the pouring rain to the police station to make sure I got the help I need. I ended up getting admitted to inpatient psychiatric care for 3 weeks. The day before I was released my girlfriend broke up with me. Upon release I took an indefinite medical leave of absence from school. For Halloween I went as a psych ward patient, lol get it ha. My life has been flipped upside down and honestly I wrote this because a friend of mine gave me the idea, but miss my old life. Maybe it was ignorance or naiveté that allowed for that, but at least I could say I enjoyed at least half of the days I lived. Now I’m not sure if I can say I enjoy one a week. Maybe a day here or there, but not consistently. I know this is super long, and if you’re still here, thank you. I am tired and I want everything to be over, but I also want to find a way through. This will probably be the first of a few posts. I’d like to think that my story can help people, but maybe it will just make them more sad like me, and for that I am sorry, but thank you for reading.",1
So I feel no motivation to maintain myself so my hygiene is very questionable. One of them being my teeth I could go weeks to maybe months not brushing them. The times I have my gums bleed a lot it eventually stops bleeding but it's so much I can taste the blood. I can't go get checked because I got kicked by my parent's medical insurance for dental care. I just feel scared that I could get cavities or I already have them or get a bad infection and need a root canal. I have messed my teeth up because I was too lazy to clean them well. I would have avoided all this but I am so stupid and gross and Idk what to do because I can't get an actual clean-up until if I am accepted back and if I am not for whatever fucking reason I am fucked. I don't want to deal with this.,1

"You ever wonder how you ever got to such a shit place? When you look back at the goals you dedicated all your time toward and worked so hard reach but it never happened. It makes you wonder what went wrong and why you didn’t deserve it. As time goes on I’m realising that I was never the problem to begin with. I thought that being constantly put down and criticised to the ground was something ever dealt with, but that simply wasn’t the case. Then you’re screwed over by the people you once considered “family” who are the cause of traumatic events and transitions that ruined your life. I’m simply tired of being used and I’ll never be respected. I don’t live my own life. I feel like a prisoner. This goes for everything else as I feel completely alienated by society and hate the general construct of the world we are told to abide by. I question whether I should be striving for these ego oriented goals. Maybe it’s just not meant for me. Sometimes I question if I should even be here. I definitely think about leaving it all behind and starting a new life, simply disappearing and never returning to shit that no longer serves me. I don’t Care about anything anymore. I think the point of life is just to exist and have fun, but it’s hard when you go back online and you are getting attacked all over again. Going online is like entering another dimension, nothing changes. There’s always going to be these parasites hating and trying to bring you down. I guess I have to find my way in the real world. I don’t have many expectations now. You are made to believe a lie, that you need all these things to be good enough in this world.. and the fact that a piece of paper, a number, determines your place in the world is just mind blowing. No one wants to get to know someone for who they are anymore and i can’t fucking stand it.

I can't tell you why I have, and I'm wracked with guilt and shame over it.

I don't know what to do. I'm so incredibly ashamed and angry at myself for how I'm acting and I'm furious that I let this get that bad, but I'm also hurt that she dropped me when I need her most and on my birthday.

"This is getting more and more annoying for me now as it is something I was ok with up until the Lockdowns and now, it just keeps hitting me nearly everyday.

I (28m) have been single since I was 13/14. For the past nearly 15 years now, I have gone without having another relationship, without dating anyone and never having sex.

I had been ok with it over the years as I opted to not bother putting myself out there after I turned 18. This was down to constant bad luck and having no clue at all with what to do. Got rejected a lot and I would get incredibly upset about it afterwards so figured that maybe it would be for my own good to stop trying to get a date so that I wouldn't get my feelings hurt on a constant basis.

Since 2014 after I got medically discharged from the Army during training, my priority has been to sort my own life out, get retrained and requalified, get a decent job that pays well, get my own place and then worry about finding someone.

And that is what I have been doing all these years. Was never too fussed about being single as I managed to get it all out of my system, was happy to do my own thing and spend my money on what I wanted. I was perfectly fine with it.

But after the Lockdowns started, it has been on my mind constantly for the past year and it is really getting to me bad. Every time I think about how long it's been since I last had a girlfriend and last had a date, I just keep breaking down and crying about it. It is so frustrating. Happens as-well when I've been talking to other people about it when they ask me and I feel so pathetic when it does happen.

I know I shouldn't be getting upset about this sort of thing and that I should be happy on my own but it just keeps getting to me. I'm sick of it. I'll be expecting people to say ""why not put yourself out there and try dating?"" I can't do that yet as I'm still working on getting a job that pays more than minimum wage so that I can afford my own place and can afford to do things that I always wanted to do. If I can't do those things then I can't afford to be with someone yet.

I don't particularly want to go to therapy about it either as I think I'd be wasting their time if I'm just getting depressed for being single. Far more concerning issues other people have that they can occupy themselves with.",1

I however find the concept of counseling stupid and also hate talking about my problems.

I guess this post is just justification for going, but feel free to say otherwise.",1

I was pleading alone in my room because I felt I would involuntary take my life in the next given moment.

They all give me excuses and never a real answer. I’m confused and frustrated all at once. I take care of myself and I am very easy to talk to. I feel like I’m being kick down in the dirt and each time I’m sinking a little deeper. I’m tired of fighting and it’s getting harder to get back up. I don’t know what else I can do. I’m lost and it sucks.",1
"I spent a lot of my adolescence depressed and actually wanting to end it. I did not self harm and never quite went in that direction personally, but it was more of a “I don’t want to be here anymore” sort of thing. Feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness. But I was a quiet child who did not share my feelings. Maybe one could assume this of me if they met me and got to know me enough to realize, but I’m not sure anyone ever did. Even my close friends… idk I never talked about it with them. I was very private.

Now that I passed that, graduated college, found a SO and passed a lot of life’s difficulty’s and kinda “survived” I oftentimes feel much better about myself. I made it to adulthood and I.. idk I just don’t have the same struggles that I used to. I actually like to think that I’m “happy” now. 

But on some days, although I guess I really don’t have a real true reason, I still spontaneously think about what it would be like if I died. If I had killed myself in the past, if I killed myself today, and if anyone actually really would care. Sometimes it makes me not want to get up. Sometimes it makes me feel randomly spiteful or sad towards friends or loved ones and think that they don’t “truly” love me. Sometimes it lasts for an hour and sometimes it lasts for a few day, and sometimes I can have it in my mind for longer and it can linger, so I can still function if needed but it’s like behind my a mask I suppose.

Right now is one of those times that I feel it. It almost feels like a siren’s song. I feel so sad and I could just decide to be gone in the next second, ya know? And my SO rests right beside me, I’m texting a friend rn casually and they have no idea. And I don’t feel like talking to them about it. There is nothing he would understand about it or know how to do, it wouldn’t make me feel better. And my friend is probably going to fall asleep in the next minute or so and stop texting. I feel like… I hate to compare myself to someone so wonderful and beautiful but it feels like what they say about Robin Williams. Like, these people I love just have no idea about me and would never see it coming. And it’s not that I *want* it to be like that. But I also don’t want them to know either. I just don’t want to feel like this anymore.

It is so strangely accurate when I say that it feels like a sirens song. It feels like… my mentality has drifted away despite what I want to think and feel. It brings me to a deep emotional state I have no control over and it tells me things that I don’t want to hear, that make me so sad.",1
:I feel a lot of pain and I can't handle this anymore..,1
"I Just needed to get this out of my chest, I don’t expect anyone to care or to reply I’m just tired. I’m just tired of going into work, fearing that I am not doing my work properly. I’m tired of constantly thinking that my co workers are judging and disliking me. I’m tired of rude customers trying to be above everyone. I’m tired of school work and trying to impress my family. Im tired of making endless comparisons between myself and other people. I’m tired of dealing with people and not having enough time for myself. I’m tired of my self hatred and inability to do things properly. I’m tired from life.",1
I don't even know what to think about. I try to distract myself but I still feel empty. It literally feels like there's something heavy on my chest. I don't know. I'm lost. My life is so miserable and I'm so tired of it. I'm tired of making so much effort only for it to not work out in the end. I have nobody. I'll always be lonely no matter what I do.,1
"Not really sure what i want my prose to be like for this. I've given ***YEARS*** of my time to people I once loved and trusted but all they really cared to have from me was sex. I don't really care whether or not they find - or ever found - me a congenial enough person to be around; I only have me to blame for driving myself into this massive ditch. I pimped myself out like a concubine for my own instant gratification instead focusing on the important things. I can't wait to be gone. Sibling would be the only person in the world that has my sympathy in such an instance, but it's honestly the exact thing my mother deserves to have a son pass away before she does herself. I think I would be enjoying a more successful life rn if I had just ""leaned in"" to being asshole all those years back, despite knowing better.",1
I just don't know what to do anymore. He won't/can get help. Lives 5 hours away. We are supporting him financially &amp; emotionally as much as we can. We can't sustain the financial support and I am emotionally drained. How can I help him? Basically just keeping his head above water.,1
"I feel so alone

I’m tired of being so depressed every single day of my life. I got diagnosed with major depressive disorder at 13 and a decade later I’m still feeling like this. It’s constant mental anguish. 

I hate myself, I hate the way I look. I’ve always been the ugly fat friend that didn’t get the time of day in real life, so now I seek it online. It’s still not enough though, I’m still unhappy. 

I feel like I have no one to go to. My boyfriend and I have such a horrible rocky relationship that it just makes me more depressed to think about. Between him in the past belittling me because of my weight, yelling at me for self harming, &amp; cheating on me for almost four consecutive years. I’m codependent, I love him, I don’t want to leave. But it makes me so sad to think about. I don’t feel good enough. 

Currently I’m bawling my eyes out, while he’s in the other room playing video games. He knows I’m going through this right now too. He left to play video games in the middle of me trying to vent. I just want someone to be here for me. I’d do anything for that. I want a hug, or even just someone to listen. I want to feel like I matter. 

Every time I’m sad he tells me I need to get help. But I am getting help. I’m on antidepressants &amp; I see a counselor every week. I use positive coping skills at home too. I haven’t been self harming on a regular basis in years, and if I have the urge I talk to the crisis hotline. But he believes that it’s not enough, apparently there’s more “help” I need to be getting. It makes me feel like I’m not trying hard enough. I don’t know what else he expects me to do.",1
I want to kill myself but im too scared…,1
"I come here to rant. Not to date lmao. Ive told so many ppl who act like they care that I want to die, and all they can say is, “so do you like me?” Like BITCH NO LMAO. I’m literally too emotionally unstable. And then get mad because I don’t reply LMAOO sorry I’m literally planning out my death bro.",1
"I have less than 9 hrs and I would say 1/3rd done cleaning my involuntary ""hoarder"" apt after long 1 yr battle with post-viral/covid long-hauler chronic fatigue, depression, and anxiety. Ran out of my Klonopin 3 days ago too! Which isn't helping! I have been paralyzed with anxiety and fatigue for 14 months. And kept putting this off until literally today. I have a new girlfriend moving in my apt in less than 9 hrs. It's already almost 2 AM right now. I'm going to have to do this overhaul overnight, and then work a full shift tomorrow with little to no sleep. My house was destroyed with garbage EVERYWHERE due to a new puppy (got before getting sick). I'm extremely lucky he never got sick from chewing everything up. But I couldn't do anything... I feel like I went through cancer treatments or something with how severe my chronic fatigue has been. I can probably get everything done in about 5 hours. How do I get back to it?? I'm taking a break but feeling that paralyzing anxiety again. I just need words of motivation. Help!",1
"I've never done anything like this before regarding mental health so please bare with me. I've just been so stressed with funds and taking care of my family. I'm currently working part time 8pm-2am M,W,F,S,SU. On top of that I'm a stay at home mom during the day with my high energy almost 2 year old. As of right now I barely see my husband because he's either at work or gaming. He's a pretty good dad but has the patience of our kid. I just had to leave my prior and higher paying job during normal business hours because my kid was getting sick constantly and my work couldn't deal with all my missed time. They told me if I called out again they'd have to let me go so I got this new job asap and quit. I'm not getting much sleep and can barely eat anymore. I'm just over it. I know things will get better but why does this part have to be so goddamn hard?",1
"Is there really such a thing as truly being happy and content. Like is that actually a feasible possibility for people? There's always another problem after you solve the first, I don't understand how anyone could truly be happy in this world.

There's always the problems you have to face on a daily basis, the looming stress of responsibilities, and world problems too big for one person to do anything about. I truly don't see how any human on this planet can truly be happy and free of worries in this day and age. Are there even people like that? Can someone give me a different perspective",1
I lay awake at night thinking of the past and how this was the worst year of my life. I wish i could just put all this behind me but i don’t know how. I worry About the future as well.,1
"It is now after two in the morning for me. I have been up all night crying. Nothing has happened to cause it. I just feel so sad, empty, and alone. I have been crying nonstop for hours. Why can’t I make it stop? I don’t even know what made it start.",1
"Does anyone have any tips on suppressing all emotion? I don’t really care anymore, but I still get emotional. I know I’m not going to be happy. But why tf I gotta be sad lmao. I just want to have no emotions.",1
"My mom mentioned to me that they're all going on a trip to a remote island for the holidays and I was taken by surprise. I work from home but its not a laptop, it's a huge desktop. If I'll try to work I'll be in a hot and humid shack and battling low internet and unpredictable electricity. I told her I can't, now my family told me I'll be spending my holidays alone. I'm strapped on cash and this isn't first stable work in years. Its also still hard to land a ""dream job"" in this climate. We know that doesn't exist They're aware of my mental health, but they're not comfortable acknowledging it. Maybe its because my culture still makes it taboo. They think me on meds makes me okay now. They even asked me to stop therapy since ""I don't need it"". I pay for all of these out of pocket too. They told me I should just take a leave without pay but I cant. I cant afford it. I'm so sad that I'm spending my holidays all alone. My depression is not good lately, and I rarely share it with them because they don't want to hear it. I'm afraid of killing myself on Christmas. Out of sadness? Frustration? Anger? I dont know anymore. I've been looking at ropes all afternoon. Thinking of a spot to hang myself or if overdosing is better. I think of them finding my rotting body when they come home, if they will blame me. If they will lie to people and say I died from an accident because of the shame.",1
"It's quite something. I've had good moments yes, but always taken place in overarching, all encompassing negative period of my life. I've effectively wasted the last decade, yet I still think that I've peaked, it's all going to be the same or worse from here onwards.
My time in high school stripped me of all ambitious, my time after high school has all been spent on trying not to think about life and losing friends while living in an area were I don't know anybody. When I do get the chance to see friends in person I dread it, as I have nothing to say for myself, nothing to add. My highest highs have essentially been what most people would consider absolute depressing mediocrity. That's all. Such a waste.",1
I've fallen into a deep spiral again where I feel completely unworthy. I have no real friends and I was used in other ways. I feel stupid and ugly. I used to cry my eyes out whenever I thought about disappearing but now I don't care as much seeing how little I matter to anyone. I hate myself and I want to die.,1
"Today I unwillingly entertained the possibility that Round 3 might be here. Stopped to think that saying ""maybe today is a bad day, tomorrow will be different"" for 3ish months isn't going to cut it any more. All the signs were there, but funny I decided to think about the possibility only when my usual somatic symptoms showed up (excessive dreaming). Where do I go from here? Part of me is relieved. I can stop calling it ""my life force has dried up"" like I did the past few weeks. I'll take depression over the latter for a few reasons. The known devil is than the unknown angel. If you're like me and have had enough episodes of clinical depression (didn't count the minor ones, may have bundled two into one), you will know that depression, like the seasons almost always has a return ticket. I see it like any other medical condition-no shame/ stigma, take care of medical necessities and the disease will take care of itself. In my head believing I have an extended flu is much more manageable than surviving the darkness of the soul. CBT, DBT, self care etc and the storm passes. I can do that. Unlike the past (2009, 2014) I don't want to tell anybody who cares about me because I hate it when I have to be taken care of, and some will incorrectly think it's their fault. It is nobody's fault, just my brain's wiring. And I am afraid, yes. Mine is predominantly high-functioning depression. Loved ones are going to see me at my best, with a smile on my face. But what if I fuck up and they leave, without ever knowing the fuck up came from a place of pain?

Can a kind soul tell me this is going to pass? Thank you. :) I can't wait for my head to feel like myself again.🤞

P.S. Frst post here, how is everyone doing?",1
"I always had my dad get vehicles. Get me mechanic help. I can’t rely on him anymore, now I have to do it myself, and I can’t. I don’t trust myself. Get a personal loan, never done it. Young kids know how to get a car with loans. I don’t know how. Im a piece of shit that doesn’t know how to pay for a car.",1
I grew up in farmhouse wealthy traditional Muslim family country with my mom and two sisters was taught everything about religion and it’s values my father lived in Los Angeles with my two brothers I’m the youngest was never in my life. I moved to US in 2017. I remembered the first time I had met her is like a video I can play in my head my first day of school in America I was struggling with my locker she helped me and gave me a tour of the school i don’t know but the first time I saw her I felt like I couldn’t even speak I just felt this overwhelming feeling I remember the way she looked her hair two years later maybe somehow however this world works I got in a random elective class and got to sit next to her she obviously didn’t even remember who I was senior year and we started talking because we sat next to each other everyday. I had too much going on at home at this time I feel like she was the perfect person I met at the wrong time she became the person I talked to the most. I wanted to just date her After a long time of talking at one point she told me about her previous relationships and how she got raped used and abused by her boyfriends I had never been in a relationship before i grew up in a very conservative Muslim environment I listened to other peoples opinions and didn’t listen to my heart and let my own insecurities control my life and let her go I even jokingly called her a slut to her face which she told me she really took to heart I wanted to just end my life when she told me how I made her feel I still dont know how I did that. Sometime later I was at a raggae concert she texted me saying she hadn’t been replying because she tried to kill herself because she couldn’t take it I tried to call her a few times she didn’t pick up and texted her something along the lines of being like how are you so fucking dumb to try some shit like that I was really drunk and smoked a bunch of weed for the first time at this concert and was having an outer body experience not in the right mindset to communicate with the reggae music bass moving your body you wouldn’t know unless you been to one high and drunk as shit after no response for a while I went back into the concert and got even more fUcked up with my friendsI think even after the concert we then just didn’t talk cause I didn’t hit her up I didn’t give her the importance she started dating someone else and seems like she’s finally out of the deep depression she was in when I met her she was not in a good place even had scars of self harm she never showed it but she was depressed but you could tell even then I treated her like shit like that she even said that her smile is real now it’s been so long I can’t get to stop thinking about her I get to crying in the shower every now and then I’ve lost my health I’ve been drinking every night look like complete shit I can’t even look myself in the mirror I wake up in the morning and think why am I even waking up I don’t want to be waking up in this world every time I go to sleep she just shows up in a perfect world where everything is alright then I wake up here I’m not even able to function in public or do the simplest of things going out and just running errands seems like a huge burden I don’t know what to do. I’m completely isolated havent been in touch with nobody not family or people I considered my good friends they all are gone (proved they weren’t my real friends)I’m really alone I’m in a foreign country completely different culture have no motivation for life don’t see a point in life not in communication with family either because of issues she was saving me from the misery I was in but I let my own insecurities and other peoples opinions control my life at the end of the day I was the one who pushed her away I didn’t feel like I deserved her either only now when she’s gone for good it’s been eating me alive I’ve been doing a lot of reckless things since I’ve been in this state and have only made my situation worse and lost a lot. Just lost my car my job gone inbr wasted time i could’ve been productive but it all doesn’t even seem to matter she’s still in my head I just want to have her I feel like that’s all I need in life I don’t know what’s gonna happen by posting this here only talk to god but he never answers,1
My life is on auto-pilot. I wish I could just stop existing.,1
"Ive had this fear for so long now that I would be better off gone and on top of that so many things have been added to my plate. My whole life i grew up with little to no family being a product of an adopted family and the ones that are around would always choose over me and throw me on back burners so I went to find love. Being a bisexual male i wasn’t accepted fully so I went on my own journey to find love and got married to someone who I thought would treasure me. In the course of things I’ve been mistreated not accepted by his family or anyone even while being married. Fast forward of me trying to come to terms with it he gets drunk and ends up going behind me back and pretty much cheating on me and lying consistently to me while forcing me to stay under his control. I don’t know what to do, I sit inside all day with the constant thought of doing stupid things to myself. Im injured unable to walk my social skills suck and no one even gives me the time of day to be my friend even if i was allowed to have friends in my relationship. Im so sick and tired of waking up everyday wishing I wasn’t here or had someone to care about me. Now im stuck in an apartment with someone that promised to make my life better and care for me that wont even allow me to leave him and I hate myself for it. More than anything this feels like an infinite loop of everything my life was meant to be but not having anyone to get through it doesn’t make it any better. Ive been on numerous apps trying to make friends for two years and nothing. What should I do? I have no options nowhere to call my home and no shoulder to lean on and im afraid if nothing happens soon it’ll just result in the worst possible scenario. Im tired of being abused, im tired of people rejecting me and ridiculing me, I just want someone to love and care for me not even just in a relationship",1
"I’m not sure how to feel anymore. It’s like everything about me feels fake when I’m around anyone, even my parents. I agree with everyone because I honestly don’t know what to believe. My reactions are not genuine because I don’t actually care. I just don’t want to make anyone feel shitty for what they said. I feel like a fucking rag doll with no emotions but at the same time there’s so much built up inside me and I don’t know how to release it. It makes me feel so incredibly alone. I just want a damn hug but I don’t think I’m even deserving of that.",1
"So I've been thinking about receiving help again after like 6 years.

I can remember a time when I was fairly normal, then some nonsense happened at 16\*, I got diagnosed with depression and general/seperation anxiety at I wanna say 18? They gave me meds, I saw a therapist, etc normal stuff. After a year or so I decided to just stop going and stop taking medication since I felt like the doctor and therapist weren't of much help and the medications they prescribed had a tendency to make me have no real emotion vs what feels like severely watered down emotions and shutting down occasionally

Just really tired of.... idk going through the motions? not really enjoying things, not wanting/being afraid to develop relationships. I have some ""work friends"" that ive occasionally hung out with outside of work, and a few of them have invited me to social interactions, play video games, etc but I just kinda make up some terrible excuse as to why I don't want to. Once in a blue moon I'll break out of it, and feel genuine drive to do things I used to love, and wants to do things with specific people, but as soon as i try acting on these desires, it feels like im grabbing at smoke since theyll disappear as quick as they came.",1
"I just wanna actually like me. GOD IT'S ALL I FUCKING WANT!

Why is it? Why do I get such an upclose view of all my flaws and failures? Why are they constantly blaring in my head?

What is it like, to fuck up and just be okay with that? To make a mistake, without assuming that it's proof that the world is better off with you gone? What's it like, to just assume you'll figure things out when you don't know what to do? What's it like to be okay when someone tells you they didn't like something you did, because you know deep down that you're valuable person no matter what they think?

Tell me, what's it like to think about who you are, and not just see all of the parts of yourself that you wished were different? Because I want the chance to just imagine it. To just fucking imagine it. Like it doesn't even seem real to me. Imagine being able to comfort yourself? Imagine not assuming everyone else doesn't want you around. Imagine thinking you improve other people's lives. Imagine being proud of yourself, imagine feeling like you haven't already betrayed all the hardwork and effort you put into getting where you are? 

Because I don't understand it. It didn't hit me until now, but I'm just trying so desperately to be a person that I can't even fucking understand. I don't think there's anything more alien to me than the idea of loving myself, of just, accepting me for me. 

So if any of you guys have been there, even for a second. Even for just a fucking moment in your life, where you're okay with who you are. Tell me, what was it like?",1
"Every Saturday I loose time by lying in bed. I can't get myself to do anything other than thinking about how much of a disaster my life is. I know that I should do something productive like learning but I can't do it. I get frustrated and stressed about being so lazy. It makes me want to just die or leave and never comeback to my life. I really need a break but can't afford to take one.
 I got COVID back in september so I couldn't attend classes for a whole month. Now I can't catch up because of my mind, that stops me from doing anything. I'm paranoid about school. I can't sleep and if I do I sleep during the day, right after coming back home. I wake up at night so I have no contact with people. I don't feel like making food, it takes too much effort. I eat sweets or nothing and it made me loose weight.

my friends told me i should be brave,but I couldn't stop thinking,when he get a closer learning about me,he will lost interest and away from me.

I know that crowbar will come swinging again but this time there will be a sledgehammer attached to a jack hammer just to break me even more. Who knows maybe I deserve the pain.

"This is a stupid, stupid thing but it really was an upsetting misadventure. 

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory: I am in college outside of my home state. I have been attending a new church while in college. A wonderful older couple at my new church gave me chocolate chip cookies and banana bread. I cannot stand chocolate or bananas, but I did not have the heart to say so. I left them in my dorm room and determined to bring them to an extracurricular event.

&amp;#x200B;

I forgot to do so. *No matter*, I thought. *I will bring them next week.*

&amp;#x200B;

Today was next week. The cookies were fine and I gave them to a friend. The banana bread, however, has a much shorter shelf life than I would have supposed. It was pretty ugly. I feel awful. First by being a picky eater, and second by being forgetful, I have wasted a very thoughtful gift, baked just for me by two wonderful people. I feel like a garbage can that people keep throwing good things into for some demented reason. *Save the good things*, I want to scream. *Stop wasting them!* But people throw their baked goods, their love, their kindness, into me, never to be put to good use.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I texted a friend from back home and asked how she was. She was having a rough day. I responded as thoughtfully as I could but looking back it was garbage. Terrible words. Unhelpful. Garbage.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents are paying a lot of money to send me to a private liberal arts college, including many musical lessons that cost extra. They're not paying for me to make the world a better place. They're paying for me to follow my dreams. Everything I do here is just so *self-indulgent*. I make myself sick. I will probably wind up doing something other than music for a living; why are they throwing so much money at something I just like to do and ain't nearly good enough at to do professionally? Whose life will be better because I learned how to sing opera passably?

&amp;#x200B;

Ugh, I can't even finish my thoughts. I feel like garbage. What a weird thing to set me off like that",1

"I'm starting to worry that this phrase may one day ring true.

You guys, I am a strong person. I truly believe that I have the willpower to fight any battle and emerge victorious. This has always been the way I am. I am the challenger who won't quit and that's what I tell myself. That's how everyone around me views it because that is how Ive always made myself to be! I want to be the hero! I want to be the phalanx who shields all with my invincible and unbreakable will. But you guys, I am crying. And I'm not crying in sympathy like I have many times before, I'm not staying up with the friends I care about who are having a worse time. I am worried that I am losing... I don't want this challenge. I want to hide. I'm afraid. I know tomorrow I'll wake up and I'll put on the invisible heroes cape again and tell everyone I'm great. Overconfident and loud, that's Nemesis! So many painful things in my life I've taken the forefront of just so someone else can live more happily. Even though this is all just a subreddit. I feel narcissistic and hate myself for this. I am strong... But here I am. Crying to myself on the couch afraid of life. The only thing keeping me here right now?

"I punch myself again today. I don’t know why. I don’t even remember when it happened even though it’s only been a few minutes. After about 2 months (which I know doesn’t sound like much but it’s the longest I’ve been able to go in years) of being able to stop myself from doing it, today out of nowhere a sudden rush of anxiety, panic hit and I did it, almost a though by reflex. I feel like such a failure. I tried so hard to keep myself from relapsing again but it seems that no matter how much I try I always fall into the same cycle. I know that I shouldn’t let this stop me from trying again but it just keeps getting harder and harder to find the motivation to keep going. The last thing I wanna do is give up but I guess it just gets harder to see the light at the end when you keep stumbling back. I just hope that one day I’ll be able to finally stop this, life’s already been hard enough as it is, the last thing I wanna do is keep hurting myself even more.

Im not even sure why I’m posting this, when I started writing I guess I thought maybe it’d help to just vent these feelings out to anyone since I don’t have anyone close to me that I can do the same with. I know this will probably get lost in the sea of new post but to anyone reading this: thank you, there’s a comfort to knowing that I’ve shared my feelings with someone else other than keeping them to myself. Thank you.",1
"i constantly feel shitty and it just doesn’t get better, even around people, i don’t feel like wow i want to be here. instead i just wanna go home and continue being a sad piece of shit. i stopped having “good days” where i’m feeling okay, now it’s just livable days or non-livable days, i stopped having days where i could go back and think “damn that day was good”.",1

I'm simultaneously pushing myself till I break and unable to work hard enough to get the results I'm after and it's killing me.

This maybe because I have very very very different thoughts and opinions. Their usual convo topics are about other's Relationships and some usual normie jokes, whereas I like convo's about song and some DANK jokes which literally nobody understands in the whole class. This all makes me feel lonely, Its like they do care for me but they don't really talk with me. I can just be a NERD and study the whole fricking day, but I also want to enjoy my life.

"I know this might sound stupid. But for the last month I have been exceelinfnin a videogame and it was a great distraction for me, unfortunately I was not good enough and was removed.

I just don't have energy to do anything, I'm sleeping into 5 every day and have no plans for the future. I have closed so many doors in my lifeni just don't know what door I can go through anymore. I tried the military but failed, I tried friends but was ignored (literally no texts in weeks), I tried school and wasn't smart enough (can't get a masters with a 2.06 gpa) and now I've tried videogames and wasn't good enough.

"When I (20m) was a child I was very bubbly/outgoing. Since then, I have become somewhat of a recluse and many people in my life believe I am depressed. 

At first glance, I seem to be doing everything right: I graduated HS with an IB diploma and currently have a 3.8 GPA at a highly-ranked college. However, my social life is practically nonexistent. Most days, I eat meals alone and barely talk to my peers outside of convenient times (""convenient times"" being after class, at my tutoring job, etc). My friends from high school and I got into a fight over text and I felt so hurt/frustrated that I left the group chat and have not spoken to any of them apart from one person since (this was 11 months ago). The one time I spoke to that person is when they called me to let me know what someone we were once close with had killed himself. Sometimes it feels like the friends I have made are simply due to circumstance rather than actually caring about each other (we are friends because we go to the same school, we are friends because we have the same class, etc). I know that is literally how most people make friends but for me it feels so disjointed like I would not be able to actually rely on that person if something were to happen because we were just lunch buddies. I try to convince myself that I am fine with this because I am most comfortable when I am by myself, but everyone in my life makes me feel like shit when this topic comes up. The weird thing is that I do not have crippling social anxiety or anything like that; I simply do not seek people out. Could it be that focusing on academics so much from a young age has fucked up my ability to care for relationships? I know this sounds ridiculous but it really does feel like I do not act normal. There are other issues that go into this obviously, which I will talk about later I guess. 

This morning I woke up and checked my phone and the first thing I saw was a FB notification for someone's birthday. The thing is that person is a former classmate who killed himself last year, so my day started off with me thinking again about how life is absolutely fucked. There is someone else I know who killed himself (the person I described earlier), and I was much closer to him. We went to preschool together. We were not best friends or anything like that, but I was there when he started cutting himself in middle school and came out as trans. We lost touch over time but it still hit me like a truck when I heard that he was literally gone just like that. I am at that age where people I knew/know start to die and I am mature enough to understand the ramifications of that, and it has just been horrible. However, I also disconnect myself from my emotions a lot, which came up when I said something fucked up about those suicides that I would rather not repeat here to another friend. I tend to say the wrong thing a lot, like the thing an emotionless rational robot would say as opposed to a living breathing loving human being. 

Personally, I have not had suicidal ideations but I worry that I may end up at that point eventually, especially when I see how much other people have suffered. I appreciate the beauty of life but also think it is irrational to act like there is not so much bad stuff that people go through. The weird thing is I feel so bad for people on the inside but barely offer them comfort when I see them in distress because idk. Sometimes I just have moments where I absorb the shallowness of life today and wonder why more people do not recognize its futility. I do not want to die, but I am also not afraid of it. I was raised Catholic (like actually Catholic going to church every week), and the whole point of Christianity (and many other religions) in my opinion is to make people unafraid of death, so I took that to heart I guess. I still struggle to understand why people who claim to be devout suffer so much when their loved ones die. After all, their religion says that life in this world sucks ass and the afterlife is good if you followed the rules, and you will literally end up with them forever anyway if you do the same. This is kind of a tangent but like nobody follows the rules anyway, so I guess that is why they suffer so much. I am gay and had really repressed that part of me up until I left for college really, but I eventually realized that almost every Catholic uses contraceptives even though it is not allowed so why am I not allowed to fuck a guy like that is literally the same sin (sex without the intention of having children). I have trouble trusting people because I feel like part of being human is acting like you are one thing and hiding the ugly parts of yourself (because lets just face it much of life is ugliness) just to keep up an image for society. 

Today I found out that I would not be getting an internship I had gotten to the final round of interviews for and it really brought me down. I started thinking about whether my education was actually valuable or not (business/econ major), which sucks because ever since I was 12 I have been working my ass off in school doing so much more than is necessary really. Like, is this high GPA really worth it? It is almost as if I am trying to prove something to myself and nobody really cares about it that much as long as I can do the job. I mean, the high GPA might even be a red flag because its basically showing I have no life outside of schoolwork. I also consider how I am not taking advantage of living away from home at all because I do not go to parties or anything like that. Perhaps I should have just went to a normal HS, gotten a normal HS diploma with okay grades, and went on to trade school to be an electrician or something. That shit is so much more in demand these days and they make a shitton of money. Me and my immigrant parents really drank the kool-aid about getting a college education. At the same time, I really do not want to disappoint them. It is not like I am going to drop out anyway because that would make no sense given how well I have done so far I may as well get the degree but I feel like nobody will hire me because I am such a one-dimensional person. If I do not get anything I will literally enlist in the military because like so many other young men I just need something to give me structure and if I am not enrolled in classes and am not doing a job related to my degree then I may as well take advantage of what is basically America's version of socialism.

Now that I am at the end of this rant I realize how many different things I touched upon while simultaneously only scratching the surface. Anyway, I appreciate you reading this far (I just really needed to put this out there because it has been bugging me forever) and please let me know about any thoughts you have about this. I really want to hear what people have to say because it feels so weird to have everyone in your life say you are one thing when you feel like they are the problem and not you.",1

"I’ve made new friends in college with some people. We all didn’t know each other that well but everything just clicked. Although I still felt insecure because I’ve never been close to anyone. I’ve always felt like an alien when it comes to friend groups. For me it’s like i’m drifting into different places. Wherever I go, I always fade away because I’m just trying to fit in. Everyone seems to have their own dynamic and connection while I’m just an accessory. Eventually I stop talking and become forgotten. Nobody ever checks up on me. Then I drift away until i’m picked up by the next group. I thought this time would be different because everyone doesn’t know each other. We’re all strangers that just happened to meet up and had fun together. I wanted to start taking initiative with my new friends. I didn’t wait for anyone to speak to me first to start talking. I’ve tried to help plan hangouts too. I’ve really felt like my social skills improved. Everything felt fresh and I didn’t have to force myself to find a role for the group. All I had to do was be myself and I’ll have a place. They gave me confidence. However the group I was in died. Nobody messages the group chat anymore either. It’s as if nothing happened. It’s been a month and suddenly everything is gone. I haven’t heard a word from anyone too. Now that I’ve thought about it, I’ve never messaged anyone one on one often. I mainly spoke on the group chat. I’m not a fan of texting and always preferred to save texting for meetups and small talk. I figured I made up for the lack of texts by communicating in person. It was soul shattering to see that the group was still alive. The friends I follow post instagram stories with everyone together. Everyone was still together but without me. There is definitely a second group chat made but without me. I didn’t fit in after all. I’ve never was one of them. They were only being nice. They couldn’t tell me no and discarded me quietly. I don’t know if I can confront anyone about this. At this point i’m just a memory and I avoid watching their instagram stories . I really am just an accessory. I’m embarrassed to even go to school because I don’t know what to do if I were to see one of them. I feel so terrible and now I’m back to this same painful loneliness",1
"So I had a best friend who was very special and I don’t know how to discribe him. First we was very good friend but sometimes he behaved so inmature like a 12 year old high school drama queen. And I got tired of how he tried to make feel guilty every time and I got tired of that so I ask him if he could not bother me for 2 months that I must on myself. He went crazy and he is not even saying hi wen he see, he does not even care what situation we are in. I don’t want to apologize because I did not do anything wrong and if I write to him I am sure he is going to act thought and like he does not care. Second my GF for 3 years has been acting to careless about our relationship. She also gets angry to me for almost everything, I feel she can not even see me.
And if it was not for me this relationship would not work. But I love her a lot and I don’t know what to do :(

"I'm sorry my issues or struggles may not be as bad as some of you guys, I really wish the best for you and that we all overcome this struggle soon.

However it is now 9pm and that pit in my chest is back, this time with a lack of motivation overwhelming me.

For non violent crimes and 2. Are because I didn’t go to court because I can’t pay the fines of everything I have and I would’ve just been arrested there anyways. So yeah why would I go somewhere where Ik your just gonna arrest me. But yeah they also took my gun the only thing I had to end this miserable fucking thing you call life. I guess a od’ing is the next option. Ever since that night I got a dwi my life has been ruined. I was cold stone sober that night too. But no one cares. And no one will probably care about this. There’s so much to say about my life and this world but there’s not enough time or words to explain how angry I am with this world and the people on it. I just want to move on to the next level.

"So… I’m so tired from my depression I don’t have the energy to take my medicine or remember to take it… which makes things worse.

Im either too cowardly or brave to actually end things and stop wasting peoples time, but reality is killing me again.

I know I need to get off my ass and stop whining. I know I have therapy and medicine (if I could remember to take them). I know I have people who would listen if I wasn’t afraid of being a burden.

And than there’s Reddit, a community of strangers who will listen to me than go about their day while I go about mine… i know none of you signed up to here my problems… but isn’t that what this is for?

i'm all talk. i just want attention. do you see now? that's why i did that dramatic enjambment between ""because"" and ""i'm all talk."" this is just one big con to make you feel sorry for you.

I hope this is fine to post like this here.

I'm regularly sitting between 5-8 on the Emmengard's scale and sometimes peaking to 9 which actually scares me sometimes. I don't want to feel like this at all.

For me, the biggest issue I have is just the general loneliness and the lack of companionship, paired with an overthinking brain which regular digs up bad memories just to take the overthinking into overdrive. I regularly get too overly caught up with girls and end up being stuck on the same girls of years on end.

I'm in my early 30s and I've never had a girlfriend. I've barely been on dates and the longest I've dated a girl was just a few weeks. I hadn't even really had a ""first kiss"" until earlier this year and I have never been intimate with a girl I was genuinely interested in... only having had sex once on a one night stand \~6 years ago to lose the ""virgin"" flag which I was so embarassed to have.

When I wasn't successful in my 20s with girls, I bought into the whole ""improve yourself"" idea which people often suggest. I'm proud of what I have managed to accomplish during that period. I've worked myself up to a high paying career now, I've built up a sizeable share/crypto portfolio which may allow me to retire within the next few years, I've bought my own place now and have a really nice car, plus I've worked really hard at the gym to keep lean and build up a physique which I'm really proud of.

I know I'm not very attractive and I really dislike being in photos. When I see myself in the mirror I generally think I look ""okay"" and have had some girls comment the whole ""you're not bad looking, I don't know how you're still single"" when I've been on dates or just out drinking with some female friends. 

I'm too often battling my insecurities. Often, when I'd get a haircut, be dressed tidy, etc. and be feeling pretty confident of myself and how I look and maybe getting a compliment on my hair or looking leaner from the gym work, only for what I think to get quickly shut down after seeing myself in a photo or video. Like, it really does suck when you feel positive only for it to just get taken away and just going back to feeling ugly again. It's not helped as well by my thinning hair which I'm actively working on to improve through derma-rolling and minoxidil.

But curving back to the start of this post now...

For me, my biggest struggle though that is dragging me down is just being too caught up with this one girl for almost three years. This has been a repeat occurrence with other girls before. This current girl has already rejected me twice before, but stupidly I kept holding on with hope that it can change as I was told she was initially interested at the start.

I have dated other girls during this time including one amazing girl who I dated for a month, however I have ended up shrugging them off because of still being too stuck on this first girl or just not feeling a connection.

This also really takes a toll on me as I'm still frequently around her so much. I'm often ending up being out with her as she's the sister to my best friend's girlfriend. So when I'm out with my best friend, often she's there as well... and more often than not it's just the four of us only. When we're out, it often would just end up with me and her talking for long periods as well which adds to the false hope, but then other times she's cold to me.

I know a solution is just to try distance myself, but as mentioned it's hard to just separate yourself from your best friend. 

I have tried it before for periods, but it then just added to the loneliness. It really did suck having to just distance myself from my best friend... and it was too hard to be honest for why I was distancing myself when anyone from that friend circle would ask where I was.

However as I type this, I'm building up the courage again to just do it all again.

I realize this post is a little odd and it feels kind of weird to be expressing myself here, but I just needed some place to offload.",1
"I was seeing one psychiatrist for a few years up until a few months ago. I tried a few of the SSRI’s and they didn’t seem to work. I ended up on 4 different medications with pretty high dosages. I had a hospitalization back in September and started seeing a new psychiatrist who wanted to take me off those 4 medications and start me on Zoloft. I told him it didn’t work before, but he said I probably wasn’t on the right dosage. Getting off those medications was brutal. It may sound a little dramatic but I’d be screaming from how depressed I was. I started off on Zoloft 50 mg 2 weeks ago. I was on that dosage for about a week. I still felt depressed but not to the point where I was screaming. I noticed I’d be okish until around 3:30 and started getting progressively more sad throughout the night. Started off on 75 mg this week. I think I’m getting worse. Now I start feeling bad as soon as I wake up and get sadder throughout the day. I cry every day. In fact last night was the first time I didn’t cry even though I felt like shit. I broke down today. Im supposed to see him Monday. Has anyone had similar experiences with SSRIs. I feel so hopeless. I just want one day where I feel okay",1
"I’m having a really tough day emotionally. I just spiraled all day with my thoughts and switched between feeling a lot and feeling nothing. I also have anxiety so I keep having to talk myself down from panic. It bothers me that I can just shut off my emotions so easily. I’m also struggling because I feel like the people in my life really just don’t get it because I can mask pretty well and do my jobs and don’t seem like I’m not doing ok. And I want them to really get it. But I’ve been pretty open about my struggles and they are pretty supportive and everything. I feel bad like I wouldn’t wish this in anyone but I do wish they could sample what it’s like so that they really understand the depth.

Then I start thinking what if I’m just trying to find someone to save me from myself? Why can’t I save myself? Why do I keep seeking others to help me? Then I feel needy and dependent and like a huge burden. And that feeds into my rejection and super low self worth.

I dunno. I kinda just needed to put it out there. I just feel really lonely and am so tired.",1
Idk what to say got nothing no one will care what I have to say this post will get little to no attention so idk why I'm making this but I might as well do it anyway I'm considering suicide but I'm conflicted if I do it i will bring so much pain to others but if I don't do it I will continue to suffer I dont have real friends I don't have a future I'm triggered by animal Crossing porn and people make fun of me for it even after I say I was forced to watch it while raped and on top of that people are completely ok with baiting little kids to watch porn and calling that a meme I don't want to continue in a world where it's normal to get kids into porn or where people are terrible to each other ik this post winter get attention because it's to serious compared to the top post where they talk about how they are squidward and shit and ik this won't get attention because no one gives a shit,1
"First I guess I should explain, I have Bipolar (2 I believe), Dysthymia, and autism, and for a while a now I’ve noticed my depression has turned into this very irritated, Schadenfreude, and almost violent thing that makes me incredibly angry with people and wish them harm and pain, and feel like the vast majority of people deserve it in one way or another just by being mediocre and feeling that mediocrity really just makes us shit in the context of our current societies moral spectrum. I fantasize about people I see as better off or doing well in life being ruined in one way or another because I’ve become almost anti-social and misanthropic enough to believe that human life has no value and that the vast majority of us are useless, disappointing, or filth. This feeling expands to myself, and it makes me kind of want to take my frustration out on them. If I were younger I would chalk this up to angst, but I’ve felt like this for over 6 years at this point on and off, and it’s causing me to struggle to feel empathy and genuinely feel positive emotions regarding my interactions with other people.",1
"I'm such a disappointment, I love learning but school is so fucking difficult for me. I thought I could be better in college, I was getting straight As for a while. But I've been having such a bad depressive episode that no matter what I've tried to do in order to make college easier and keep my grades up, I'm going to fail all my classes again and waste money. Again. And fuck up my GPA.... again.

My dad says ""just work on your college and you'll be fine"" well I fucked up too badly for that. It's too late. I'm not redeemable in that field.

I like working but I want to work in a job that's meaningful and pays well. I want to make enough money to be comfortable

I also care WAY too much about what people think. My life on paper reads like I'm a lazy failure and that's cause I am. High school? Barely passed. College? Failed. All cause I'm too stupid to persist and keep at it. There's always something, some outside circumstances or personal flaws that prevent me from succeeding.

I also spent a bunch of the money I've saved for years on a car that I don't even know if I even like, because I needed one so bad.

God I really want to be grateful for the human existence and to be alive, even though life can suck, but it's hard when I hate myself!! I want to be successful like people say I can be. I want people to think I did well. But I shat on the small chance I had at that. Not to mention covid ruined all the decent things about me. I guess I'm supposed to ask for help but I don't even know how I can be helped I just wish I didn't exist. But I won't kill myself cause I'm too stubborn for that.

I just feel like no matter if I succeed, get a life I ideally want, it won't solve the sadness, anger, and self hatred and hatred of the world within me so I won't ever be happy. So it seems pointless to even try rn",1
Me and my sister are very close. I'm 44 and shes 41 and we've shared a room in our house for many years and we do almost everything together but last night I found out that she had a private wedding with my son and didn't tell me. I'm not too mad about missing her wedding but its mainly that she has been in a romantic relationship with my son for 2 years. I was extremely mad when she told me that they got married and that she is currently pregnant so I told her to stay at our parents house and now my son is upset with me because of it.,1
"It is possible to be so fucking sad and miserable right? Like I don’t need a reason to die right? 

Why do I feel so garbage?

I just want to die",1
"This always happen to me whenever I try my best to look for the right person to seek help.

I got traumatized when I decided to open up with my friend and he just said ""Haha you're so dramatic. Quit it,"" When I messaged my adviser in school it was ignored. I tried discussing it with my parents but before I can say my case, they said ""Deal with it on your own whatever it is. Don't be childish,"" When I talked it out again with another friend, whom I thought was finally able to understand me, she said ""Hahaha I swear I'm gonna laugh so hard when I see you in a mental hospital,""

From that time onwards, I don't know anymore. I just keep saying ""I'll be fine. I'll be fine. I'll be fine,"" because I'm afraid a lot of them will really laugh at me because of my mental health issues. It's scary.",1
I’m such a fucking loser. Can’t even motivate myself to do homework and now I’m weeks behind and am probably gonna drop out of fucking community college next semester. My family knows it. They know exactly what I am and that I’m never going anywhere. Hell I’d be lucky if I wasn’t homeless in the next year. Maybe I should just end things. That would be easier.,1
"Just a check in: Still feel like shit. Been very anxious lately with my gf for some reason. If I were to lose her it’d be game over. Not sure I’d choose suicide, but at the very least an absolute disappearance and me falling off the face of the earth to everyone I ever knew. Guess maybe we’ll see. Hope not.",1
"So I’ve come to the realization that I have high functioning ASD and for the last 5 days, I’ve been doing nothing but laying in bed and crying all day. This shit fucking hurts. I was already diagnosed with PTSD but the more I looked back on how people treated me like I was subhuman compared to them, a lot of things started to come together for me. All my life I’ve been laughed at, people would look at me as if I violated them, I’ve been called creepy as well as retarded many times just for making careless mistakes, I’ve been sexually assaulted and had people physically hurt me unprovoked. Everyday people would pick at everything about me from the way I walk, stand, pointing out my extreme nervousness and shakiness, as well as my awkwardness. Everything I did was considered wrong. People really thought I was stupid and would speak to me in a condescending way you’d speak to a child. That would irritate the hell out of me and I didn’t know why I was treated this way. Despite me not following social cues, I’m very sensitive and can tell how a person is actually feeling internally. Meaning I know when they’re playing nice to me and not actually telling me how they’re actually feeling. Then when they leave, I can hear them saying awful things about me behind my back. Most of the time, I’m never wrong when it comes to these things. I just didn’t know how to respond when people would treat me this way.
Imagine going through life thinking you’re normal and you think you have decent social skills. The people you’re speaking to act as if they’re liking you so far. But then you say something wrong that offends them. Now all of a sudden they start targeting you and forget about all the nice conversations they had with you. Now you’re a target. Now more people become aware of you due to gossiping and start to watch your every move. You see them laughing at you but you have no idea why. Or better yet, they start to ignore you and pretend as if you don’t exist to them and become visibly uncomfortable whenever they see you. This is what you’d have to deal with for the rest of your life and there’s nothing you can do to stop it.
It doesn’t help that this shit is hereditary and I was the only one in my immediate family to get tested. The rest of my family is totally oblivious and think they’re normal too. Once I got tested, I realized how off my family really is and thought everything that we did was considered normal. It’s no wonder my ex friends would never want to visit me again. Now I’m barely functioning and terrified of leaving my home. I hate feeling this way. No matter how normal I try to be, nothing is ever enough. I’m exhausted and wish I could stop breathing. I can’t even name one positive thing about myself. How can I? I’m not even considered human. I’m lower than trash.
Due to everything that’s happened with going through life undiagnosed, it’s no wonder I’m extremely paranoid, very prone to shakiness/nervousness, and refuse to ever put in the energy to speak to people again. I feel like I’m in hell and don’t see any of this shit ending ever. I’ll always deal with strangers laughing at me, give me dirty looks, or treat me as if I’m invisible by putting their hands on me because they know I won’t do anything about it. All of this shit has traumatized me to no end that therapy doesn’t seem to be helping me.
Life is passing me by, I can’t drive due to my anxiety disorder, still live with my mom at 20, I feel crippled and disgusted with myself. Anything I do is considered “cringe” and my existence will always be used as a joke. I thought this would all pass but I was sadly mistaken. The fact that the majority of people are still ignorant about autism and how not everyone that’s autistic is the exact same, makes me feel inadequate and unworthy of being seen as human.",1
"I was going through some old notebooks and came across one that I hadn’t written in since 2019. Reading the last entry, I realized that in two years, not much has changed in how I feel. The only difference now is that I have no one and it’s my fault. I cut off everyone in my life who actually cared, isolated myself for the past two years. Now I’m fully alone. Even back then, at my worst I had people to lean on. Even if it was just one person. I keep seeking acceptance from people around me, but I’ve come to realize that no one actually cares and I don’t have the energy to keep trying. Why do people have to be so shallow? They care so much about looks—the one thing we cannot change about ourselves—and not enough about who we are as people, which is something we can work on. I’ll admit, I need to work on myself and invest in my mental well-being. I’m just tired of feeling insufficient for things that I cannot even control. I spend so much of my time hiding, hating the parts of myself I was born with all because society told me that the way I look is not appealing to others. I hate the way it is wired into everyone’s brain, all of the societal standards. Not just beauty, for everything. The way I’m supposed to act as someone who was born female, the way I’m supposed to dress, the way my body should look, my physical beauty, what I should do with my life. Im supposed to fit into this mold the world wants me to fit into but I don’t in any aspect. I am the furthest from everything societal standards praise. I force myself to act feminine and convince myself I am, when in reality I don’t know what I am because I’ve been too busy trying to fit into this cookie cutter shape. I wear clothes that are seen as weird to others, even if I feel most comfortable in them. My body isn’t perfect. I’m not athletic, but I’m not overweight either, which is somehow worse because no one can outright say I’m fat because I’m not, but I know they are still judging me for my unconventional body. My features aren’t perfect. I don’t have that perfect jawline, those perfect pearly whites, that small button nose, the perfect face shape. None of those. I am expected to know what I want to do by 18. Our brains aren’t even fully developed at that age, and I’m already expected to be thrown into the world with a plan. Neurodivergency is seen as being lazy or being a failure for being different or thinking different. Im tired of it. Of all the expectations and standards. Im left with my thoughts all the time and no one to share them with except a blank paper or a white screen. I do not confront my own emotions. I bury them deeper everyday. One day, I will run out of dirt and eventually everything I have been forcing down with collapse on me. Until then, I am here, blindly venting on a subreddit in an attempt to feo anything except empty melancholy. There is not much left of me to give.",1

"It's taking everything I have just to keep going. I've been depressed my entire life, the first time I remember wanting to die was when I was six. I don't want to kill myself, but I don't want to exist. I truly want to get better, and I've tried, no one understands how hard I try, but nothing seems to work and I just don't know how to keep going, I don't think anything is ever going to get better. I think maybe I deserve all of the horrible things that have happened to me, and maybe I actually am as awful as my depression tells me. I've lost so many people. I'm so scared that everyone is going to leave me. I just want to be ok, but I'm so fucking tired and I know there's nothing I can do.",1
"Since I was very young I have think about it, and sometimes now in the present I think about it too.
When I'm in my worst state of mind I say it would be just easy to not be here, I don't think I would do it now, like, I have never really planned it, is just like an idea that pops in my mind, but sometimes I think in the future, if just an amount of things happen that would make me feel really bad, I am scared that I'll just do it
I would love to have a family and have kids, but I don't know if I would be able to control me does anyone else think like this? is something wrong with me? what can I do",1
"that's it. i think the title is literally what describes my psychological state right now.

i have had mental health problems for many years of my life (i'm 20 yo now), i went to a psychologist for the first time when i was 5 years old, i was diagnosed with anxiety depressive disorder more than 2 years ago and i have been in treatment for almost the same time.

during all this time, i've had a hard time but i've never thought about wanting to finish it all, in fact death and diseases are probably what scares me the most in life so you know.

after my physical symptoms caused by depression have intensified in the last few months (tachycardia, loss of balance and much more neurological and cardiac shit), my doctor asked me for an MRI and today the results have arrived.

i was dying (lol) to find a tumor when i read it, like thanks for the death sentence so i don't have to k¡ll myself lmao anyways good night y'all",1

I even started to feel the fog lift. 
The bad days were less. I knew one bad day would be just that, a temporary thing to ride out.

"My biggest mistake in my 31 years is expecting the truth from people, my kindness has left me with ♾ trauma, questioning my physical and subconscious self leading to a spiral of self hatred. Love yourself more not in a narcissistic type of way but enough to keep yourself protected from those who seek to take advantage of you at certain points of of your life.

They lady at target who rang me out asked why I was buying so many (I have a big family) I told her I was dying and they’re for my family when I’m gone. I’m sure she thought I had cancer or something. But still. She started to get emotional and started crying then she made me cry. Telling me all kinds of nice things and that my family loves me very much 😭😭 we ended up hugging each other sobbing. After I collected myself in my car I decided to give it another shot just for her.

"It's been over 2 years since I stopped seeing her. It's almost like every time I begin to get a little bit better and move on life brings her back into my life only for a brief moment, leaving me heartbroken, and fucked up once again. I'm insanely, completely in love with her. But I don't think she wants anything with me anymore. She was the only girl I ever really felt a real connection with, and I fucked it up. Of course she would have eventually moved away and it would have eventually ended. But I beat myself daily because if I would have valued her more at the time it would have lasted longer. I wish I could go back in time and beat the shit out of myself and scream at myself that I need to value her. If I had known that that night was going to be the last time I ever saw her I would have stayed a bit longer like she asked me to. I would have kissed her many more times. I would have never went back home. I hate myself for being so young and stupid. I seriously feel like I cannot continue in my life knowing that shit is not in my future. I'm pissed at life. Why am I in this circumstance? This love is eating me alive and I need to stop feeling emotion somehow. I'm so overwhelmed. This fantasy world I've created for myself isn't real. She doesn't love me.

"I dont know if this is the place to post this, but it's been on my mind the last few days.
A little background - So I've dealt with severe depression for the last 20 years, since my teens. End up in the hospital every three years or so (I always check myself into the ER/a facility when I get to the point where I'm not safe by myself - I've actually been really good and not had an attempt for 14 years at this point and I'm really proud of that (sorry for the detour)). Generally think a little about wanting to be done with existing every day (really every day) but that's generally just passing thoughts. There definitely have been good times, and a few great times, but the majority of the last 20 years have been hard, and when I'm alone and in my head... it's really rough sometimes. You guys know. Covid was especially hard - I just moved to a new city on the opposite coast (usa) and kinda knew one person there and my work was paused for a few months (thankfully I still got paid) and I ended up flying to my parents and going to the hospital because I was so anxious (which was new to me) and desperate. Got meds, a therapist, all the things and eventually found a mental space where I was fine. Still depressed, but like 'normal depressed' where I can still function as a human and be kind to others, but I go home and feel like shit and just get stoned all the time to wipe away the time. And all I did was watch anime and think. Two weeks ago something happened. I think it was that a lot of the things I was thinking about (my direction in life, making connections with people, where I wanted to be and what I wanted to do,) things I never had answers for I finally found a direction. I think that's what's caused this. And I guess at the same time I randomly started doing the things I wanted to do - like cooking healthy meals (instead of ordering out every night and eating garbage), setting up a bedtime routine, keeping my house actually clean, talking to siblings I haven't spoken to in a decade. Normal human stuff that I don't do when I'm depressed. I slept in my bed instead of on my couch for the first time in eight months last night. I've been trying for weeks but just wouldn't do it. And it finally happened!!! I've just... I honestly don't think I've ever been this good. Like I feel so good and happy and calm and wanting for life. I thought maybe it was mania because it's just so unnatural for me to feel this good, but I don't think that's it. I think I'm just in a positive, healthy head space rn. But I don't know how to hold onto it. I know I won't be this good forever, but I really don't want to back slide. How can I hold onto this? I'll continue trying and doing the positive things I have been, but I'm afraid that if I fuck up once that I'll lose it. (I know that's not necessarily true, but fear is weird and I do back slide a lot.) Side note: As I wrote this I thought that maybe while I'm here in a good head space that I should try to ride that perspective to forgive myself for decades old sin.
I guess what I'm asking is when you guys are in 'good moments' have you found any successes in prolonging good feelings and keeping depression in check? I have more momentum now than maybe ever in my life, if you guys have healthy suggestions I'd love to try them!",1
Growing up I thought that living alone would be awesome. Doing whatever I want? Eating whatever I want? Who wouldn't want that!!! But I'm so lonely. There's no one to share things with. I do the same things everyday but for what? I'm falling deeper into this hole and I just cry every night thinking of how alone I am. I try to go out and just be around people but the loneliness is still there. There's nothing to fill that void.,1

I may or may not be becoming depressed again. I'm a college student who is in a creative dump, experiencing extreme imposter syndrome, a lack of motivation, and personal life conflicts that involve family. I've been seeking help for treatment but I feel like I'm on this constant rollercoaster. One moment, I'm enjoying my life and everything I have. The next, I feel like disappearing for good. It's awful. I don't know what to do sometimes. 

Recently, I have been experiencing this feeling of being disposable and worthless. I've had some bad experiences with people on campus and with my family. My self-respect became damaged after that. Sometimes it feels like there's nothing I can do to fix this. It feels like I'll keep experiencing this cycle for the rest of my life. I feel both incredibly overlooked and replaceable. 

I have a friend who is aware of what is happening. I know they mean well and they love me, but it sometimes doesn't help the more I hear ""it will get better."" I don't know when, I don't know how, and I don't even know if I'll even be here when it gets ""better"". I lost the spark of hope from that phrase. Even though I know some people care about me, there's this stupid pounding feeling that I'm better off gone. I don't know what this means.

So I had more guy friends but they all didn't really want to be my friend. They wanted to be more and it made me so sad. Cause all I wanted was a friend. I'm sad that I have no friends. I did give alot of love and support to others in my life without expecting in return but in the end, I just have no friends..
The lack of meaningful relationships in my life sucks. I think it's maybe because I'm always trying to please and I'm not actually myself, the imperfect less fun me.",1

"I hate that I don’t know what I’m doing with my life. I procastinate a lot but I’m trying to get better at it because I’m really scared of failure. The other day I was talking to one of my siblings and they said something that’s really been weighing heavily on me. They said, ‘Just know that if you screw up your life, then you’ll be the only one in the family to do so,’ and I know they didn’t mean any harm by this, but what they didn’t know is that I already feel like a screw up. They didn’t know that I constantly berate myself for not being as ‘successful’ as my other siblings and for not being as motivated. I’m a freshman in college and I’m currently failing. I don’t know what to do, I have no one to talk to &amp; I need help.",1
"I have been working very hard on self hatred and depression. I attempted suicide some time ago over a failure, and I've finally had a day I really enjoyed.

She manages a food truck and I'm selling food for my big brother and when we're at the same event we don't let each other pay for our food.

So I just handed her a massive amount of cookies saying ""thanks"" and all and she came out with her dad and we talked about life. She said I was really sweet.",1
"Last night I came home after injuring myself in a jogging accident -- scrapes and stuff.
It just really made me break down and I told them how I have felt. I had been contemplating saying something for months, but my whole life they've given me nothing but reasons to not trust them I tell them and just get yelled at and made fun of, told I'm dramatic and stupid.
And I just feel completely fucking aweful. It's been pretty obvious I'm not well fore a while, last year and a half atleast. I stupidely assumed Id get some sort of sympathy and they would say they care after I legit said I've wanted to end my life. But no, so I have no clue what to do. I feel embarrassed, today I haven't talked to them at all, I find it absurd how I am made to feel guilty and a terrible person for admitting suicidal thoughts. I just feel so suffocated now. There's just too much to fix and it only compounds, I don't know if it's possible to fix it all. I'm just tired man, I can't enjoy anything anymore. I feel like a burden, I don't want to tell anyone ever again now, no one cares.",1
"I know I sound like some edgy kid trying to be philosophical or whatever but it's kinda all I got.


""It's always on your mind of wishing you could disappear or die but never making plans for it, whether out of fear, guilt, or not wanting to harm yourself.
But it's no way to live. Sometimes I wish someone would just give me that final push though, it's like people hurt me as much as they can without pushing me over the edge. There's this sick desire to finally have a reason to do it. But what exactly is gonna be the thing that finally does it?
Sorry I always vent to you, I don't have many outlets and you're kinda the only person who cares.""",1
"Seeing these people is very difficult for me. I absolutely despise the fact I can remember that old sharp pain upon the glance of their faces, like glaring into the sun in it's blinding dawn light. And In the blindness I see glimpses of bitter memories untold kept within me, reignited once more. I can remember that old winter holiday a while ago, it was under that waning night sky I realized the odds are truly in favor of my madness and self-extinction, it was the night the year came to an end, and so died the last glimmer of faith in my soul, for myself, and for others. I questioned if I should disembark from this dread through the graceful embrace of death, or to tread forth in this museum of my life and create more hollow artifacts of my sorrow to add to the story of my irrelevant shell of an existence. I do not hold anyone to account for not reading my thoughts or emotions. We all have our own worlds within, and I do not expect others to see mine. But I cannot help but feel a particular hatred for these people that I  consider ""family"" and ""folk"". Always feign in ignorance to the dark well I resided in when I was within their presence, no matter how many blood-curling cries for aid and salvation I exerted, nothing would come to my respite, I would continue to fall further into the hole, further into bitterness, further into hatred and lunacy. I never saw a hand reach down that bottomless well. Maybe because it was too dark for me to see it, or there wasn't anybody there at all. But the fact is that my dreadful experiences have desensitized me to respecting humanity, and God forbid the humble stranger cross my sight, I cannot even bear my own, for I am alienated by my own sense of self and belonging. Hardened by lost time, I have no faith left. For most it was a holy night, on that holiday, but for me though: it was yet another  marker of despair. It is this very barrier that separates me from others. That while others are blanketed in escapism through the cycles of time, be it through reunions and jolly events of gathering, I am fully exposed to freeze over, only ever seeing the abyss, and I can no longer bear it. I have grown sick of dreaming of a better world, where all that is sacred constantly reminds me of death. I have become distrustful, distant, and incapable of sharing the warmth I seek from others myself. Things I never thought I would say: ""to damnation with the tyranny of ethics, morals, and empathy!"" have become key-place in my heart. What has it ever done for me (empathy)? But betray me again and again! There is a particular artifact in this ""museum"" I mentioned. It is a painting of my deepest fears of possible futures. Fairly new to the museum, but this one horrifies me. For it seems to be enchanted with the ability to fortell fate itself. Within this rotting painting is a bitter and vile forest, many trees are affected by the decay, one in particular  has a branch broken off and left to wither away into the vast unknown. Now devoid of purpose, the branch becomes a conduit for many uses. But it's fate is grim, for lost with it within the wild was also a flaming ember, which then descends upon this lost branch, unting with it in chaos, and conjuring a flame, which inevitably becomes so grand that it engulfs the painting itself, burning away the rot and decay along with all the wilderness within, so then it is that in the ash it is reunited in oneness and purpose to the blackness of the forest by death. Death to me, so often has had a similar appeal. An appeal to the marriage of me and human community, if not on Earth, then in the darkness of sheol.",1
"I’ve never been in a relationship and I’m starting to feel that It’ll stay that way till I die. I hate being alone like this. I have some friends and I go out from time to time but nothing ever goes anywhere. No matter how what’s I try to be outgoing, I just end up feeling and looking more alone. I don’t think I’m ugly or anything, I’ve been hit on before but was too scared to do anything. My chances have come and gone and I’ll never have another again. I seriously feel im going to die alone at this point because everyone I know my age has or has have someone. But I never been in a relationship.

"Alt account clearly. I've had depression my entire life. Well for as far as I can remember at least. I never really thought I would make it this far. I am happy for small amounts of time as in a few days maybe a week but then I sink back down. I am at the lowest I have been in a very very long time. 

I once had a life. I was married. Tried to be the perfect spouse, still was cheated on. My ex kept our kids from me. It's been 10 years now. I have since remarried. My soulmate I am convinced. We are the same except my crushing depression. My partner doesn't have the problem I do. 

I find myself thinking of the past lately. I was so very unhappy and miserable. I lost over 50 lbs the year my ex and I divorced. I am physically healthy now. Yet again I am severely depressed. I feel like I don't deserve to live.

My spouse is perfect and supportive. Loves me unconditionally. We are reaching the age where we have to decide whether or not we want kids. I feel completely torn on this bc of the past. I feel I don't deserve to be happy or move on. How do I build a new life when I feel so broken from the past. I feel like such a broken person and that my spouse got a shit deal marrying me. Over half of the time I feel like jumping off a bridge and ending it because I just can't see a happy future for myself anymore. I don't know what to do anymore. My job adds to my misery. I am starting a new one in hopes of making steps towards being better. At the same time what's the point anymore.",1
"My bestfriend of 10 years (I'm 18) who knows each and every single thing about me like everything. Just told me she's ""done with me"" and doesn't want to talk to me. I feel so bad I have no one to vent out to she was my only good friend isn't it crazy how easily people give up on you. I feel like crying my heart out and just screaming. 

This is so fucking painful. I don't even have someone whom I could open up to

She broke me I'll never be able to trust someone again how I trusted her. I fucking hate people. Why does this always happen to me why",1
"My life up until now has been a complete waste. Through middle and high school, I was a poor student, due to sheer laziness, and my social life was lacking. I’ve graduated from school 2-1/2 years ago and have felt lost since then. I don’t even have my driver’s license yet. Currently, I work at a home improvement store, but I don’t plan for it to be a long term career.

My future plans are uncertain. In terms of career, I’ve been thinking about being an entertainer of some kind, maybe a storyteller, but I have my doubts. I want to write a story, but I don’t write much, and I haven’t read a book since school. I feel like if I pursued that, I would suffer from a massive case of imposter syndrome. If not entertainment, I don’t know what else I would do. I’ve considered work like engineering, software development, accounting, or some sort of medical tech, but I’m intimidated by the schooling; I don’t know if I could push myself to be a better student than I had been. 

In terms of relationships, my family life is weak. I’m distant, and I get angry at my parents easily and snap at them. Sometimes, I think ill of them. I fear one day I will be disowned due to my religious beliefs, and that probably has something to do with my attitude. I haven’t had a friend in a long time, and I question whether I ever had one at all sometimes. Throughout school, my peers have seldom invited me anywhere. I think I can count on one hand the amount of times I’ve been invited out, and one of them was purely out of pity. In those times, when the summer break came, I found myself alone in my room everyday. After graduation, I was alone for 2 years, granted one of those years was during the height of Covid, but it has to say something that my life then hasn’t changed remotely from the previous year.

I am incredibly insecure in multiple ways. I wish I was intelligent, strong, and admirable. I think I’m losing hope in living a good life. I wish I could start over and give myself a good foundation for my life. Sometimes I wish I was just a different person altogether. I want to apply myself, but I’m too lazy to actually do so. I’m like a baby who needs their hand held.",1
I've honestly had absolutely enough I look like a boy in the body and face so that doesnt help apparently I have ok lips so that's another reason why girls hate me.

"My 16 year old sister is cutting herself on her inner thigh and i just found out the other day. She told me she’s been doing it for a month (not sure if that’s true or not.) i talked to her about it the night i saw and told her i’m here for her and we had a deep conversation about how i want to help her and be there for her. i told her i would help find her a therapist and i bought her a journal. she’s really stressed with school and my parents and ‘everything’. A few days later i talked to her about it again and she told me its the only thing that gives her relief. she said she’s tried to stop but can’t.
i don’t know what to do or how i can help her. i’ve never had someone in my life that cuts so i’m not really experienced in it. I also don’t know if she’s doing this because she’s suicidal. i’m just really scared for her. 
any advise is appreciated ❤️",1
"Sometimes I feel like we're supposed to be depressed, like when life really does suck and you're depression because of that. 

Am I wrong in thinking that true depression is something that even rich famous people can feel? Vs just feeling down from genuinely having a life that sucks? 

How can I ever really tell the difference between the two when Iv'e never been in a good living situation or financially stable?

"I’m not sure if this is truly depression related but this sub is the closest thing to a group of people that might know what it feels like not to have the will to do anything 

I used to know what I wanted to do in life. I had direction. And then I actually tried doing it and it ended up being shit. I’ve always loved automobiles since I was really little. So I figured why not try to be a mechanic? The schooling was great but I also realized I don’t have a social life outside of school and probably never will. I just simply do not care to interact with anyone.

Anyways, long story short I get into another trade and it ended up being laborious and shitty. The car working on part didn’t suck so bad it was just the people and the stress. And I was also being emotionally fucked by the fact that for whatever reason I just randomly get upset about my ex’s and can’t let things fucking go. No matter how hard I try I can’t stop being upset about them. And this still happens with relationships I had years ago where my stupid brain just gets upset for no good reason over someone who doesn’t love me anymore I fucking hate it 

I got fired and was devestated and ever since then I had zero motivation or direction to do anything else. My parents kept teasing me saying I should go work at McDonald’s. I’ve had shitty labour jobs in the past and would rather jump a cliff than to do something like that again. 

and when I get upset I just buy stuff. I never noticed I did this until recently. I always associated buying stuff online with Christmas, and usually you are pretty happy at Christmas. So for years I’d just keep myself content buying parts for my car. So I’m basically broke scum but I have a nice car that doesn’t work properly. It’s the only thing I’m proud of",1

I have friends but they either live far away or aren’t available to hang out. But it’s so much more than that. I have no idea what I want to do with my future. I have no sense of purpose or direction in my life and I hate it. I just dread existence and I hate how hard life is. I suck at my job and simply have no worth at all. Would really appreciate some kind words.",1

I've been sick for the past month and a half or something, and none of the doctors knows what I have. Well, in all honesty, they said I have basically nothing, but my throat is still fucked and my lungs still hurt when taking a deep breath. (Highly doubt it's COVID, I don't literally leave my home. I only went out a couple times in the last month to go to said doctors lol)
I even told myself I'd stop smoking to see if that was making it worse (which it probably was), and 24h basically just hit, and here I am, prepared to smoke again. I've never felt so worthless in my life. I'm so upset at myself I haven't even eaten anything for a couple of days. The worst part is I know I'm doing everything wrong, not taking care of myself, not treating people properly, and that just makes me even more upset. I truly wish I'd never been born.

My husband recently took a job about five hours away from where I live now. I have spent the day frantically packing, but at times I randomly break down crying. I have lived in the city I am currently residing for 8 years. It is the first place I really consider my home. I am excited to have a more stable income, but where we are moving is a very backwater area, and I already know I won't care for the culture there. I grew up in a rural area like it, and I did not fit in. I don't really care about making friends, and I plan to keep to myself. 

I have been having a lot of anxiety and troubles sleeping. I read somewhere that moving can set off a bipolar episode. I have Bipolar 1. Do any of you guys have tips that will help me transition to my new home without having a major episode? I have been stable for over a year now, and I have been clean and sober for 18 months. I know from experience that an episode can easily destroy any progress I have made.

But fuck I wish she didn't call me tonight.
It's been a hard semester (junior in college) and honestly, I've pretty much hit rock-bottom with my depression. Really struggling in my classes, have zero social life or friends, and am overall just very unhappy. My mom calls a little bit after I getting home from work. Talks a bit about the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday and then we start talking about school. I mention that it has been a hard week and that I have been struggling to keep up my friendship with someone (that also struggles themselves with mental health issues) as it seems like we are drifting apart. My moms says: well yeah, I understand her. People like her and me are really struggling right now. You just don't understand what it is like to have depression.
Me: Um, yeah I understand as well...
Mom: No, you don't. I honestly couldn't decided if I wanted to cry or hang up the phone and not speak to her until Christmas. I don't think I've been this heartbroken for a long time. I know she has never taken my mental health seriously but I don't think she has ever said it right out. Overall, I just don't know what to do. No one in my family (even people like my mom who have been on anti depressants/in therapy for years) or anyone seems to believe that I am hurting. I just feel so ignored and not believed
This Summer I even worked up the strength to tell my doctor and she acted like I was *lying* to her and told me that it ""seemed like I was handling it well"" after I told her I had some of the good ol' ""bad thoughts""",1

 I've stopped going out except for groceries. Distanced from all of my friends , so much that I don't know if I can even qualify them as friends anymore. Everyday , I wake up , try to distract myself and make time pass just for everything to repeat yet again. I feel so useless when I could do so much more but I'm too tired.

 Everyone is technically waiting for death too , but they do it better than I do. They enjoy their life while I just exist , I have a roof , food to sustain myself ect.

They broke up with me because of the chronic pain I'm in that stopped us from doing certain fun things together. Which trust me I would love to be able to do those things! 

They have everything in life, always had, money, success, loving family and happiness. I have nothing. Never have. No money, a crap dumpy place to live in, no social life or friends or family...I've become so bitter and lost and alone and I really want to move on with my life. But it feels impossible now, even after such a long time.

People say to me that it's better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all... Its total BS! I was so much happier and mentally healthier before I ever loved someone. Now I'm a wreck... And they are happy.

I don’t care one bit as long as he is happy, but my parents are strict catholic and come from a different time so I’m worried about their reaction (they will accept it in time) but I’m worried because my dad has already had a few complications with his treatment and that it will set him back because he worries. I’ll support my brother no matter what but at the same time I don’t want them finding out about my brother whilst my dad is going though his cancer treatment… I do not at all want my brother to hide who he is and I wouldn’t out my brother ever, as I feel it should come from him but he wants to tell them soon… what can I do?… is it selfish that I want him to wait just a few more weeks when my dad finishes treatment? we are a super close family and he’s told some of my aunts about it and they are really supportive",1

In my heart, I know he is worth it and I do not want to give up on him. I am aware that I need to be cautious to not lose myself trying to help him. He is on medication and goes to therapy but he deals with a lot of life struggles and his depression makes him feel like life is not worth living sometimes. When the cycles start, he starts becoming distant, says he does not want to talk, and talks about how much he hates life. I wish I had people to talk to about this because it is difficult and I do not want to get my family and friends involved because I know they won’t understand. Depression is one hell of a disease and I really try to be understanding with him but sometimes I feel helpless and don’t know what to do.",1

I never wanted to do this shit in the first place 💔",1
"I'm seeing a new therapist so I can get on some medication that will help with my depression but more importantly the ability to do things. I told her about one particular thing I need to do, and she told me to do a little bit everyday. Obviously that doesn't help or mean anything at all to me. So how do you describe the inability to do things without sounding like you're just lazy or putting things off on purpose or just procrastinating.",1

"I truly was feeling so good today. I was well rested, my coffee tasted perfect, and work was really easy. I showered, did my hair and make up and was definitely feeling myself. I reached out to a few friends to see if anyone was interested in getting dinner or going out, and no one was available. My mood changed so quick. I put on some red lingerie, am almost done with a bottle of red wine, and cried alone while watching Taylor Swift's short lil film. No one can wait around for me to feel good, I know that, but it still bummed me out. At least I still look hot I guess.",1
I live with so much guilt and regret. I can’t get over it. I can’t forgive myself for the mistakes I’ve made. I can’t forgive other people for hurting me either. I’m so full of hate and sadness all the time. I feel disgusted by myself. I dislike most people. People can just be so shitty. I don’t want to live in a world like this anymore. I’m not strong enough to do it.,1
"I(34m) am not sure how to tell my wife(33f) that I feel I should be commited again. We have 3 boys (7, 3, 1). It feels like she would be incredibly angry if I were to say it, as when I've mentioned being depressed/suicidal she tends to say stuff like, 'Its not fair for you to say/feel that,' , 'How do you think that makes ME feel,' , 'If we(herself and the kids) make you so unhappy why don't you just leave us,' . 
Some background:
I've been fighting depression and alcohol/substance abuse since 15. We've been married 8 years, together for 9. I have twice attempted suicide since we've been together, once before that. The last attempt ending up with an involountary admission to a psyche ward. I spent a week there drying out (DTs suck in that setting) before heading to a month long rehab. This was July last year. Have been sober and clean since and have been taking antidepressants for 1 year. 
I am feeling super guilty for thinking I need to be hospitalised again as I know how much she struggles by herself with the kids. There are no family supports nearby as my mum has MND and requires heaps of care, while her parents are overseas. 
I'm totally lost and losing my grip as every day passes...",1
"I don’t think I’ve ever been so disappointed in myself. I did the work, I got better. It didn’t last long because soon enough I was right back where I started. I know what I need to do to get better, I just have no motivation to do it. It started with not eating well, then eventually I was having trouble sleeping again. Now I’m isolating from people like I did before. The worst part is the suicidal ideation. It becomes an obsession for me. I feel trapped in my own body and it feels like the only way out would be to end my own life. I can’t forgive the people who hurt me and I can’t forgive myself for those I’ve hurt. What sucks is that, for a small moment there, I was happy. Or at the very least, I successfully tricked my brain into thinking it was happy. Now I’m back to square one. I’m tired of always having to start again.",1

"I'm a 29 year old Indian man living in Paris, France. I was diagnosed with depression and got a lot of therapy between the age of 20 and 26 years. I've always been academically good. I studied hard and got into a top university in Paris for my MBA. 

Getting in was not easy given how challenging the entrance processes are, but, after no success in 2018, I got back on my feet and secured a place in 2020. 

I've been looking for a job since about 7 months, not a lot of success, lots of interviews, rejections, same old story. It all funnelled into the last couple of weeks where I got into final stages of interviews with 4 companies. Lots of work put in, case studies, an average of 8 interviews, etc. Etc. 

Got rejected by 2. Left with 2. 

One of the 2 invited me to Amsterdam for an interview round, I paid from my own pocket and showed up. They grilled me for 2 days straight. I did a sum total of 11 rounds of interviews with this Dutch company. 

And today my prospective boss called me and told me that ""they're concerned my being an MBA posits a challenge to their culture and also we haven't interviewed enough candidates. I deeply care about you (lol) and want you to take any opportunities you might have available."" 

I can't get myself out of bed, can't sleep, nothing. 

I'm left with one last opportunity. My motivation is depleted and I feel like I've lost everything I've worked for, for 5 years straight. 

Fuck this. I'm sorry if I made typos. I just can't keep it together anymore.",1
"I need help. I’ve been depressed for a long time now and I’m looking for someone to talk to about some of my problems. I’ll just start from the beginning. This is going to be all over the place so maybe not the very beginning. Everything is true, and may contain spelling and grammatical errors.

When I was a kid I lived with my father and his mother, I believe I was about 6 or 7 (that’s as far as my memory will take me). It wasn’t too bad, he bought me a Super Nintendo which was awesome and I played Mario and other games as a kid. Around the same time my mother decided she wanted to have custody of me, that’s when my life changed.

I come from a big, and I mean big family. I have nine brothers and four sisters, same mother, and only one half brother and one half sister. I don’t think any of them liked my father much at all, but they knew I did…which is why I believe they disliked me so much. When they came home from school they would take their days anger out on me, punching my arm, using their newly found wwf moves on me, once I even had a front tooth chipped because my brother used a wooden handle from a reclining chair on my face. Life kinda sucked, but I was a kid and didn’t really know why this happened.

My mother was worse. She would make some stand in the corner of the room with my nose against two walls, one foot off the ground and if it dropped so would I as she would take her n64 power cable and create the most painful welts on my back. Do you know how hall closets have that small space underneath the hanging clothes? That was where I slept. Most of my time wasn’t in there though, it was in the living room being blamed for one thing or another.

Food was also something that I was only given enough to not be dead. So often did I only get a paper bag with a cold hot dog and a handful of potato chips. I mean I get it this was a BIG family, but I shouldn’t have to sneak up in the middle of the night to grab a handful of hot dog Mac and cheese from the fridge just so my stomach wouldn’t growl loud enough to wake up my mother. One time my sister fed me and my mother threw a glass plate at her hand making it bleed, I never forgot that day. I love my sister so dearly for that. I tearing up on the thought. 

When my aunt came over that’s when it got real worse, I believe my aunt hated my father more than anyone which is probably why my mother wanted to beat me more, to prove she hated even someone who loved him. I ran away not too long after that, mind you there are some things that I’ve been through in that house that I am not mentioning.

I ran away to a dennys in downtown Sacramento with nothing but my bare feet and two dollars. I asked the lady what I could get with that much and she told me to keep my money…she got me a grand slam. I believe that was the first time I had experienced true, unscathed kindness. I really hope she is well to this day. Not too long after that I walked out and was stopped by a cop, I was put into foster care. I swear I wasn’t a bad child. I have been through 22 foster homes (most were only taking children for short term, and by the time I was at long term homes I was too old for them to want to adopt me), 1 elementary school, 2 middle schools, and 7 high schools. 

I’m now a 29 year old man with huge emotional and trust issues. I’m depressed and lonely. I’ve never told anyone this. I just want to put it out so when I go to the therapist I hopefully don’t cry a river like I am now. Thank you very much for taking the time to read this. You are not alone.",1
"I want to destroy myself in every way imaginable. I want to torture myself and put myself in pain. I deserve it. I want to starve myself, I want to cut myself, I want to drug myself until my brain turns into mush and I’m far gone from reality. If I can’t shoot myself in the head then I might as well destroy myself. God, I’m a piece of shit with nothing going for me in any aspect of my life. I want to project all my depression and anger inward and completely obliterate myself.",1
"In my eyes I have become “God” aware. No not a Christ God type thing.

People think we are special because we are “self” aware. Many other animals have displayed self awareness when we put them through the mirror test.

What makes us special as humans is not this. It is that we can be aware of what is outside of us and see how the mechanisms of life work.

We can see that we breath in oxygen and out carbon dioxide. The trees take in carbon dioxide and expel oxygen.

This is just one of many mechanisms we know and understand. There is no “Brain” for these mechanisms but they function with an in built intelligence. This intelligence is everywhere and in everything! The smallest things we can understand (Atoms) have this in built intelligence they know to bond with each other and make something new, they bond together like this all the way into creating the body that I call me. This intelligence is the most abundant thing in the universe. This intelligence is my God and I am aware of it now. It’s not mystical or magical it’s life and it is beautiful.

I am so appreciative to be human and that I have been given the gift to see this beauty like no other animal can. 

These are only my thoughts the reality is it’s not the thoughts that’s makes me question my sanity. The thoughts don’t do it justice. I feel this to my bones. It energises me, it fills me with love and compassion it makes me feel completely as ease with everything, sometimes almost exctacy 

I don’t know what has happened to me. Am I losing my mind?",1
"figured this would be a good place to ask for advice on how to take care of my hygiene when i have literally no motivation

so basically here's what i have trouble with:

i havent ever had a cavity and i want to keep that track record but im lucky to get around to brushing my teeth once a week.

i have really long hair and though i wash it regularly, i never brush it, and it is a PAIN to get a brush through after leaving it sit for a week or so.

i am really bad at washing my body (yeah, i know, tmi) and it's gotten so bad that im getting like.... some sort of fungal/bacterial infection under my boobs regularly 💀

anything unlisted either is taken care of or i don't care about, but feel free to give advice on other things too",1

"So to start things off, I've been ""a little"" depressed for a good length of my life. It started because a person close to me really young died of cancer when I was in elementary school. After that tragic incident, I began developing health anxiety. It got so bad to the point where it was interfering with everything I do (my parents don't give a shit about how I feel). After a couple of years the pandemic came along, I started playing video games everyday. It became a great escape because it distracted me from my anxiety most of the time. But over time, things got bad. I started to enjoy gaming less and less. The only things that kept me playing were the friends I made during those couple of months. My health anxiety was back and I was in a struggle already. But things went from bad to worse when school started again. My parents cut my wifi from my computer. This was a huge hit because half of my social life was the internet. I negotiated a deal with my parents and we agreed upon letting me playing on fridays and weekends. But after a while, they suddenly cut my wifi on weekends too. I asked them why but they refused to tell me. I quickly fell back to the vicious cycle of health anxiety because I have nothing else to do, especially on the weekends. I almost gave up on trying in life because nothing felt rewarding anymore. Anything that I enjoy gets ruined by my anxiety. No matter how hard I try to make myself not worry, I can't. I really can't do anything except worry to death in my bed. I would really like some advice from people of reddit. I'm always interested in alternatives to gaming (not drugs of course lol) or ways to cope with this anxiety. P.S. I'm a freshman, that's why i've got nothin to do to distract me. My grades are great and my school doesn't nearly give me enough stress to prevent me from worrying.",1
"what is wrong with me? Why I can't be happy?

I am litteraly pushing away the one single friend that I have. I feel unreasonably angry towards him because he is happy meanwhile I am sitting on cold bathroom floor and crying.

And I have no other friends. Over 1.5 years I didn't manage to find a single friend in college. I feel so pathetic. I had a class today and I didn't talk to no one. 

I miss my parents. They are the only ones who would care about me. Sadly a lot of km separates us.

But how on earth everyone managed to find friends except for me.

Before college I thought that money will be the most stressful thing, however being alone is something else.

Sorry for incoherent rant. I have no one else to talk to about these things. Thank you.",1
"Recently I started going to therapy bc enough was enough. I knew I obviously had some issues with my mental health, but I never thought too much about it because I can usually get things done. I go to work everyday, on time, and do a good job (I’ve been a server for about 8 years now so I know what I’m doing). I go to the gym and manage to run errands every now and then when I need to. People even oft tell me that I have good energy and am usually really positive. I’ll admit, I try to be as nice a person as possible and live by the golden rule of treating others how you want to be treated. 

Though, through therapy, I’ve found out that I might be mildly to moderately depressed. I told my therapist that while I manage to get things done, I still feel hopeless about the future. I have no goals, no expectations for the future, and ultimately deep down I feel like life on Earth is pointless. Yeah, I guess the point might be to try and make the world better than when you found it, but in the grand scheme of things I just feel so insignificant. I’ve had HUGE issues with existentialism because, in reality, who’s going to remember you in 100-200+ years. We’re all just atoms that unless you invent something or do something groundbreaking, you won’t be remembered and your name will just disappear in the future. The probability that you’ll become one of these memorable and life altering people is so minute. 

Lately, I’ve notice my depression getting worse. Trash around my room, doing laundry but leaving it in huge piles on my bed that I sleep in, even trying to send job applications or applying for an apartment seems so mundane. I can’t even get myself to enjoy my previous hobbies like music or art. Thank god I’m still managing to go to the gym. Yet, after all this, I’m still managing to go to work and do what I have to do because I feel like I have that responsibility.

So my therapist says people have varying levels of depression. Some are more productive like me, and others are worse off. Yet, she still recommends I be on some kind of medication because night after night and day after day, I feel like shit for so many reasons. I feel that life ultimately is pointless. I never was asked to be born and put in this shitty world, and sometimes I think (and only think) of what would happen if I was gone but then it’s back to work, or self studies, or the gym, or job hunting. It’s tiring and I’ve really given medication some thought though the psychiatrist I was referred to still won’t call me back to make an appointment. *sigh*

Anyway, how are you guys doing?",1
I'm a harassed a horrible person. Just trash. My therapy appointments leave me feeling like the worst kind of person and I cut after them because I'm fuxking stupid,1
"Me: *reaches out to people when I'm heavily depressed and near to suicide*

People: 🤷🏻‍♀️ 

Yeah. Why the fuck do I wanna try anymore? It's all virtue signaling. People talk big game about supporting those of us struggling with depression and suicidal ideation. But when we actually reach out they don't do shit. 

I'm so goddamn tired of staying alive just to hurt so bad.",1
"Im a guy in gr 12 and for the past year I have just felt nonstop depressed unless I have friends distracting me from all my thoughts.

A little while ago I made a huge mistake, I broke up with my girlfriend of 3 years because she also deals with depression and stuff. I was being selfish and thought that her problems made mine worse so i broke up with her.

Right after we broke up I starting talking to another girl and it made me feel sorta happy again but that faded pretty quickly from all the guilt and sadness of losing my ex. Only after I was with another girl I realized how much my ex helped me and mattered to me.

Now I am with this girl and she is someone ive always known and is fun to be around but I dont wanna drag her down with my sadness and moodiness. Its gotten bad enough that she has been noticing and it gets even worse from seeing my ex hanging out with some of my guy friends.

One of my best friends said I should try taking a break for myself since making other people feel bad makes me even worse. Ive really been thinking about just tryna focus on my self and not date anyone but idk if thats the right choice or not as I already regret breaking up with my ex.",1

The issue for me is that I can never stop taking my epilepsy medication and it has significant effects on my brain chemestry. I'm think of trying to lower it but because of my several s\*\*\*\* attempts. Do you think it'll ever truly be safe to get off?

"Depression apparantly runs in our family. Two of my sisters have been diagnosed, and I’m currently seeking help myself, and it’s becoming clearer and clearer to me that my mother most likely is depressed. 

She has bad hygiene, is ALWAYS late, always tired and is always able to sleep, never takes off her makeup, emotional eater, is the biggest procrstinator there is (i.e. when going to the dentist, making doctor’s appointments, buying something we need, she always postpones it to the max). She’s also very distant emotionally. 

I’m going theough a really fucking hard time, and I’m suspecting I also have depression, and I need someone to be there for me, and help me through this process but she obviously is not capable of that. I keep asking her to help me make doctors appointments and she just says yes and procrastinates. She isn’t emotionally present in my life, and she never asks genuine questions. I’m just so fucking angry I need help so bad but it feels impossible to do alone. I’m the quiet polite middle child who stays out of trouble, so my problems dont alert her that much, but I’m FUCKING STRUGGLING.

My other two sisters are/were troubled kids, and their lash outs were big. Their depression made them stop going to school for weeks at a time and start drinking and doing drugs. They would sleep all day and stay up all night. I’m not like that. 

I’m an academic overachiever and my depression doesn’t manifest like theirs. I may be competent in school but I’m so fucking empty. I have no personality anymore. the bubbly child I used to be is nowhere to be found. I haven’t had a real connection to another human in maybe 4 years and I can’t take it anymore. My hygiene is shit, I dont give a shit about my hobbies anymore, I’m asocial and a dark cloud to be around, all of my emotions except sadness and anger are numb. I need help so bad but I cant deal with having to keep track of all my appointments and have to call people, i just need support, but it seems like I’m not going to get that.

"I bombed all my classes last school year after a depressive episode, neither of which I have told anyone about.

I feel like I’m on the same slippery slope as last year and I don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel anymore. At least I can dissociate and spend money on stupid shit to make me feel better",1
"I don't know how to explain it. I don't even know if I'm truly depressed, as I've not been diagnosed. But I know that I shouldn't think or act like this at 22.

I lash out in petty ways, and find ways to think myself into a cycle of despair to justify crying. I become clingy and I become angry at my friends all at the same time. I just want to find an excuse to scream and break shit. I turn away from my responsibilities and let myself get lazy and sleep and sleep and sleep. I blast edgy music as if it helps at all. My emotions become completely unpredictable, I snap at the smallest things, I get pissed off, then desperately sad, like a goddamn metronome. There's no stability. I curse the world, I call it pointless, even though I live a very good life. I beg for attention and for someone to notice like I'm not a fully grown adult capable of calming myself down. I manipulate others and trick them. All because I can't make sense of my own desperation.

It all makes me feel so juvenile. So petty. And exactly like I was when I was 15. Only thing missing now is the blades. I haven't changed or matured at all. And it worsens my already aggravated self-loathing to remember that. I should have grown up but I just can't, I'm too caught up in a selfish frenzy of being too weak to shake off entirely unjustified feelings.

I am an adult. I am not 15. I should be above giving in to such immature urges. I should suck it up, learn to cope, learn to make friends, schedule therapy, stop drinking, exercise, all things I know I am capable of. But I don't want to, because I'm lazy, like a goddamn teenager. And so I don't. I say I hate myself for it but even that isn't enough to change me.

I'm so incredibly disappointed in myself.

If anyone else feels this way, I would love to hear it. It feels like I'm too weak to win such a simple fight. Growing up shouldn't be this hard. Or rather, I shouldn't be this stubborn about not growing up. I don't know what to tell myself or what to do. Advice or solidarity appreciated.",1
"When did I actually lose my life, my world, the world itself as I see it, and have ever known it, everything... . Like what is this...?

Never had any ambitions in my whole life, nor did a whole lot but at least I was witty, made people around me happy, always had a positive mindset even in the face of setbacks, enjoyed living, and enjoyed thinking and learning. 

I've become so incredibly unintelligent, and purposeless that I'm disgusted with my inability to form coherent thoughts, or have a direction regarding anything every. single. day. I can barely even read anymore, without losing my train of thought... .

I'm disgusted with this increasingly individualistic, unintelligent, and decreasingly group oriented society we live in. People are becoming more and more unintelligent, and the world reflects that.

These are just some examples:

Global ""unsolvable"" problems, virtue signaling, adverts everywhere that seem like they're made for chimpanzees, a crude and heartless working culture, absolutely disgusting architecture, and runaway individualism (e.g. aspiring to be ""unique / different"" with horrendous clothing choices, increasingly obnoxious music, etc...).

Why did we have to degenerate to this? The best architecture we've ever had was in the reneissanse, and that was 6 centuries ago...

For years I tried to better myself doing anything I could. I guess I managed to make myself feel a tiny bit better but thinking about partaking in a society I feel no connection to at all, and just pointlessly surviving, dragging myself through a floor made out of glass shards, without a god, without a drive, without a place to be... . My mind fully rejects such an idea.

I guess, considering how my nature is and always has been problematic regarding getting by in a materialistic society I always had this coming.

But still, how am I supposed to exist here without even being alive anymore by all means and purposes... .

I want out, I want help, I want a purpose and a drive, and more and anything, more than anything at all, I just want to feel decent one day, and not like I'm going to faint every single moment of the day, high blood pressure, a clouded up mind, and other problems... . Please... . I'm suffering here, and nothing can help me...

I just feel disconnected and nothing makes me happy whatsoever its really weird…",1
No one wants me. No one deserves me. Everyone deserves better.,1
"I feel like I'm not progressing fast enough. People i graduated high school with are graduating college but I'm not even close. I'm working a warehouse job that i hate, i still live with my parents, I'm not smart, and I don't have my life together. I have people I could reach out to but every time i start to, i panic and back out. I can't even ask friends for or tell them how i feel. I feel bad always wearing a mask and telling them I'm fine, but it's second nature at this point.",1
I feel really depressed.. everyone hates me,1
"I don't really want to do anything, I don't even know why I do things anymore. My only interest is environmentalism and distracting myself by playing video games. I'm to anxious to go meet friends and to lazy to hang out with people I know(specifically irl), I just want to go home and distract myself for hours on end. I get super stuck in a routine in situations that can cause me a lot of anxiety so when I go to college I do the exact same thing every day, same path, same spot, same clothing, ect. I honestly have a lot of energy and my mind is clear but it's just lonely and uninterested. I go from thing to thing on youtube, watching videos about battery technology, a video game, solar panels, veganism, music, whatever my brain wants. I wished I could just do things I enjoy and make money off of it, but frankly money has never been a motivator for me. I don't really want things, I just want to think and do stuff. I ask the question so often, what is the point in this, why can't we just do x, why are people fighting eachother, if the world is this way to make it so that my consciousness can experience something interesting why can't I just turn it off and take a break. I really want a break, and no matter the length of the break it'll never be enough, and I'm just stuck here. I considered just driving myself off a cliff or something and dying, when I was driving I made a vivid visualizations of me killing myself. I don't want to hurt anyone else I just want to press the pause button pretty much forever, they can continue on without my awareness why do I have to be stuck in this body. Truly I wouldn't choose another vessel but I just don't want to be here anymore. It's really sad that I have to do things, and I mean my mind will do things constantly but my awareness just doesn't want to experience anymore. Why am I even here, why am I aware of what is going on, why am I me, why the hell can I not turn it off. Can I beg enough to just leave, how do I even leave, I like it when I'm dreaming because there is no more awareness it just happens then all of a sudden I'm awake. Why do I have to be awake for the real part, I just look down at my hands and my arms and I question why is this me. I feel like I'm looking for an impossible perfect solution and I kind of wished suicide was legal and death wasn't such a problem in society because I would like to just be euthanized tbh. I'm like knocking at some system beyond where the explanation is unreachable and I want out but no one will let me out and now I'm trapped inside a cycle that I regret deeply. I feel like people would think Im insane for feeling this way..",1
"I need help. 

I've fallen into a depression i cant get out of and idk what to do. 

Im late 20s male, single, have no friends, no girlfriend, live alone, and more recently unemployed- living in a busy city but mostly introverted. 

Last year i ran into some bad injuries that I'm just getting over through PT but its slow progress- and I'm still in pain... 

I'm depressed every single day and idk what to do. 

Currently working on trying to get a job, i dont have many skillsets. 

I just feel so empty, incapable and worthless all the time. I dont have any passion for anything anymore.

Feels like im hitting rock bottom right now... And it just really sucks. I dont know how to get back up guys... Its really hard :(",1
"Title says it all. I fucking hate the self victimising ass that I've become. It's addictive. I realise that. I wasn't dealt the best card in life but I didn't have it THAT bad either. A lot of factors ruined me but the biggest one is myself. I ruined it all.

The worst part of it all is that I'm fully conscious of it all and yet I do nothing about it. If I gather enough strength to do it, I don't know where to even begin. What talents do I have? If there are any I don't know how to utilise them.

I sit around and do literally nothing but listen to sad music and overthink about all my failures in life, leading to anxiety and panic attack. Why the fuck can't I just get up and start doing something about it. I'm sick of myself. I hate myself.

I've just sat through the entire night, it's morning outside. I wasn't playing any games or watching any series/movies. I just sat... just sat, listened to more sad music, more overthinking and did nothing. I felt tired and still refused to go to bed, why? I don't know wtf is wrong with me. I put myself through this torment every night, I've been doing this for years now. I have nothing to do and I still stay up. And I know it's bad because in these hours the thoughts run rampant but I fucking do it anyway, guess I'm just addicted to those thoughts of self pity. Fuck me, I'm such a bum",1
"Rant sorry for the length

Today is my birthday. I am 19 years old. I spend part of the day in day patient treatment as I got out of the psych ward 3 months ago for my eating disorder and am still in part time treatment. I am on sertraline but it feels as if it is doing nothing for me and everyone is pushing it on me and insisting that I keep taking it and ive tried everything to get them to reduce the dosage but it never ends up happening. I don't give a fuck. I don't want to take it anymore. It makes me feel like I'm living a fake life and having fake emotions. My whole life revolves around this shitty daily routine that I've created and when I'm next going to be able to smoke or take in some form of substance. I turned up the other day high on diazepam and I just couldn't get through the day so I had to go home. I am so deeply bored and I don't think anything can make me happy anymore. I cried and cried for hours today and my parents were so angry that I was so ungrateful that they had tried to make this a nice day for me and all I could do was cry. Every day is just waking up, dragging myself out of bed and either going to treatment or eating and then going back to bed and sleeping more. Then I just watch videos because I can't focus on anything. I'm meant to be going to Cambridge fucking university next year with all of these super geniuses and I can't even read a book. I can't get through a single book all the way through no matter how short it is because something just stops me and I end up abandoning it. What are people going to think when I turn up and I'm the dumbest one there. I don't even know how I got in. I feel like I don't deserve it. I have always had trouble with concentration and attention but it's so bad now and I also can barely get out of bed so apart from treatment have barely left the house in weeks except to go to the shops maybe once a day to get this drink I like. I am so much more social now. It's like when I'm around other people I'm a motor and I am always talking and coming up with things that make people laugh and contributing to conversations but as soon as I get home I'm a completely different person. I waited for years, years and years for things to get better and maybe they have and I just haven't appreciated it enough. The only respite I got from this was through starving myself half to death which I don't want to do again primarily because I need to go to university next year. But it's so tempting to just throw it all away now that I know that I am going through this same numbed out life where I just do nothing but waste time. I don't know what to do to be happy. I'm convinced at this point that it doesn't exist and people who say they are are just lying.",1
"Apologies in advance if this isn’t ok to post. My [28F] SO [29M] has been in a depressive episode for the past 3 weeks or so since the weather has gotten colder. Our relationship is wonderful, but he’s really struggling.

He’s already seeing a therapist weekly and thinking about starting SSRIs. I also sat down with him yesterday and we made a list together of daily self-care habits. Got some vitamin D, getting in the habit of going for walks before work in the morning, and I’m picking up more of the household chores for now. 

So I’m basically just wondering if anyone here had any other ideas for how I can help him or what you would find helpful for an SO to do. Thanks in advance!",1
Do you ever find yourself making your life worse and hurting your future on purpose... its so weird with depression sometimes ill want to change my life and be the next Elon Musk and other times I wanna curl up in a bawl and smoke a joint.... idk man.,1
It’s got to the point I have to come on to Reddit to talk about this…. I’m happy this exists. I’m 18 years old and left home when I was 16 to come to the uk to escape how I was feeling back in America. Feels kind of ironic for an 18 year old to say I was young and stupid but I was I really believed I could run from it…. And u can for awhile with brand new distractions and drama about your new life decisions. But it caught up to me. My parents and I have never really been the same it’s much better now we have talked things out and I’ve moved into a beautiful new flat by myself funded by parents while I study overseas. Before moving into this flat I was staying with my aunt for a year. I’ve tried a lot of things to try and make myself happy here and it seems like everything is making me worse….. I’ve met girls on tinder and invited them over and just feel terrible the next day and regret the very thing I wanted the day before. I want company because I’m lonely but then when company comes over I feel out of place. I’ve tried getting high and to be honest a little too much weed recently I’ve been burning through too much money. The high is great until it’s over and your out of weed. I’m not great when alone with my own thoughts and to be completely honest I don’t think I’m ready to live alone but I was unhappy living with my aunt and unhappy living with my parents but nothing like this now that I’m here. I feel stupid talking about this…. I live in a beautiful flat that I don’t deserve I come from an upper middle class family. Sometimes I feel like I want bad things to happen to me so I have a reason to be unhappy. But In reality I’m a spoiled teenager that has a really good life. Family all around me and friends back home in America. And the fact I know I have a great life makes me feel extremely ungrateful and I feel totally out of touch with reality and a bit of a prick even writing this … but I can’t stop the self pity and overall cloud of unhappiness. It’s not deep deep depression it’s just a constant feeling of slight discontentment.,1
"i feel like i’m not really a person, i feel like im just like a carbon copy. like i feel like there’s nothing original about me, like all i do is just copy others, fashion, humour that kind of thing. like it’s an odd disconnect. i feel very out of it, like i don’t i have an identity that isn’t dependent on other people.
i feel like i’m a two faced arsehole who’s just horrible and doing badly at everything and just devoid of joy and burnt out. like i feel i don’t deserve anything good that will happen to me or whether i should have anything good happen to me. i don’t feel like i deserve my friends because i feel like i’m this horrible human being.",1

"Help! I need advice.

I friend of mine just told me she's struggling with depression (or well, from a list of common symptoms, said she felt them all) but she apparently grew up in a household where mental health problems are just something ""you swallow, they don't exist"". Apparently she did some self harm and admitted she hated herself and they did absolutely nothing. She thinks if she wants to get help for her condition they won't supoort it. What should I advise her?",1
I use to be energetic but over the years I can feel the sadness taking over. I don't have a lot of friends and the few activities I really enjoyed doing I either dont find interesting or can't get the motivation to do. I also haven't had a relationship in years and its kinda hurt me that no ones been interested in me since I've been a pretty good athlete. Life just seems to be getting worse and I'm only 19,1
has anyone tried transcranial magnetic stimulation? i’d love to hear about your experience with it and the results. my psychiatrist suggested it &amp; i’m a bit hesitant..,1
"I'm 21 years old, I drop out of college and I don't have job, for the begging.

I feel like burden to my parents constantly but I do nothing to fix it because I don't even have energy to do so. Last year I got diagnosed with severe depression, anxiety, depersonalization and derealization separate and ptsd due extreme trauma of constantly losing people I love and constant physical harm in middle school and home (my mom used to abuse me alot). I constantly changed psychiatrists because all of them didn't believe I had any problems and one of them histerically laughed when I told her I lost my life long friend couple weeks before that. But after I found right psychiatrist I got diagnosed and got put on seroxat and alprazolam for start. Then she tried to put me on mood stabilizers and antipsychotics when she started questioning for bipolar. I also have severe medicine abuse in past so I knew antidepressant and alprazolam will help me without need to abuse them but mood stabilizer was the one I used to abuse so I got scared of telling her reason I want to change it and told her it's not working. Antipsychotic was awful to say at least. I couldn't wake up and I cried all the time when I was awake without even feeling any emotion so I stopped using them on my own. So here's important part. My psychiatrist was out of town for my session so they sended me to someone else. Also before that psychologist who worked with me told me that I should tell truth if I want help. So I decided to actually don't say things abot doing good and tell everything and actually seek help. One of the reasons for me to stop using antipsychotics was weight gain, I've been dealing with body dismorphia and I got afraid. So, I told psychiatrist about bring unable to focus on anything, constant dissociation, trauma and meds abuse (I never abused illegal drugs). He didn't believe me. He told me I'm lazy waste of space, pathological liar and that he don't care about what happened in my past. ""People come here with real problems like conflict with boss or something and here you are telling me about starving yourself for your moms attention at the age of 5 like, that happened years ago who cares about that"". Also things like ""I don't believe you don't ever abused any illegal drugs but you heard about mood stabilizers"" and ""You're just lazy and spoiled so you had to come up with something to gain attention"". I don't want to tell what also he said but you all got the point. I left room and started crying, I wanted to kill myself after so much time of ignoring those troughts. My mom used to tell me since I was little how I'm faking everything for her attention and all of that started when I actually stopped eating to for real get her attention. So I don't know anymore if I for real have problem or I'm just starving for attention. But also on other hand I don't tell people what's going trough my mind, this is first time I actually talked about having problem after that psychiatrist appointment. Also last time I went there to seek help. Right now I'm just waiting to slowly die and get heart attack from not leaving bed for months and abusing meds again.",1
"I am doing everything within my power to better my situation. You would think that having a decent amount of cash could help you, but it just isn’t that f u type of money that I need. Everything I try someone is always there to tell me no. I don’t have the luxury of ending it all early. I took on responsibilities and I can’t figure out a way to honor them. Everyone has their breakthrough story on how they got through it all and I ain’t got shit. I’m back to square one. It’s taking everything not to fall down in utter dispare and depression.",1
"I really don’t think I can ever be genuinely well. Like even if I try. If I only had my anxiety disorder and the depression sure, maybe eventually it would get a little better. At least the anxiety part. But I’m also autistic and I can’t change that, My depression will always be fueled by that. I will have to keep living my life hiding in order to fit in with the average person. I hate this all so much. I hate how easy it is for other people to just go shopping or something like that. I hate how they can just feel comfortable meeting friends and be themselves. I can’t do anything.",1
"I started taking 10mg Vortioxetine for chronic depression approximately four weeks ago. I have recently experienced a quite a few depressing events. However, I cannot even cry or express how I feel about these events. Instead, I feel so numb. 

Is this normal? Will I ever cry again?",1
"Ultimately, I've been feeling like my emotions are not as intense as in the past and like I don't enjoy things as much as I used to. I don't know for sure what lead me to feel like that. Usually I don't feel depressed, but maybe emotionless or empty. There's rarely any situation that makes me feel excited or sad (this numbness applies both to positive and negative feelings).
But even though I don't feel depressed, it's still really bad, because I feel like I'm kind of dead inside, and doing some things seems just meaningless... Also, I think it affects my interaction with other people, as it probably makes me look like a boring person.
So I've been wondering what might have caused these feelings and if they may indicate symptoms of depression or not.",1
"I don't need anybody to comment. Just want to let it all out.

Came off anti-depressants about 2 months ago and I feel week by week I'm getting bad again. 

This week has been a real test.
Just have not taken care of myself. All I've wanted to do it lay in bed. If it weren't for my SO I don't think I'd have got out of bed all week. 
Lack of motivation in job, eating is either skipping meals or over eating junk food, just everything feels so...mundane. 

Thoughts are foggy and I'm just not interested in anything anymore.

I keep thinking about going back on anti-depressants but definitely worried about the first few weeks back on them 😔

I want to fall back in love with life again.",1
"I know that happiness comes from within. I know I am supposed to take steps to make myself feel better first before anything else. Everything feels so hard. It’s like I open these doors just to face a brick wall. It feels like nothing feels like an opportunity to pull myself out. I can’t even cry. I feel so so sad all the time. The only thing that gets me to cry is to contemplate scenarios of ending myself. Which probably means I’m not suicidal but what is the bar for the feeling before that? I wake up every morning sad I woke up. I feel so alone and I don’t see an end in sight. I have been struggling for a really long time. I don’t even feel like I know myself anymore. I don’t feel worthy of love or friendship even though in my heart I have so much I want to give. I am scared to give though. I’m so scared of the rejection I feel I’ll inevitably face. I got to get out of here but I don’t know where to go. I eat to numb myself and it’s become a pretty bad addiction and coping mechanism. I smoke often. My body feels bad. More than anything I just want a really good hug but I am scared to express those feelings to anyone. I feel stagnant and trapped in my own head. It’s hard for me to put myself out there. I sit in my closet often pretending I don’t exist. It’s deff made my depression worse, fucked up my sleep schedule and what not. I spend money like it’s water. I know I need to stop these habits and I’ll feel better. It feels like these habits are all I have to soothe myself. I wish I just had one person in my life who I felt supported by and I think it would be a lot easier. I am suffering everyday. It’s my own fault . Nobody is going to save me. I wish I was good enough.",1
"Guys idk what to do, so I have severe cramps, I even pass out from them and sweat buckets I can't live in constant pain they are so severe that I'm scared to do anything just to not to get them(Been to every doctor they didn't find anything). I've been to psychogist and he said that it can be from mentally pain that I'm holding inside (LIKE WHO DOESNT AND WHY IM ONLY ONE GETTING THE FUCKING SEVERE PAIN).. actually I almost committed yesterday it because I couldn't bear pain. Now I'm in pain too, If it's going to continue I really might lose my mind and kill myself. When I talked with my mom we fought instead with words. Idk what to do . I'm depressed as fuck from getting bullied, from pain I'm bearing, from ocd because I cannot touch anything in the house it gaves me paranoia, help me please, someone I beg
The only thing is stopping hearing my mom crying over my dead body , even though this feeling is fading so fast",1

My life is hard in every aspect right now. I have a support system but it’s only two people, both of which are involved in some way with my trauma etc and are family and my spouse. 

I cannot stop thinking bad thoughts (5 previous attempts). It’s every minute of every day. The depression is heavy and needy. Worsened if anything goes wrong, no matter how big or small the problem. I just lose my shit. I feel as though all I do is cry and sleep. 
Tried to talk to my only female friend who isn’t my family about how I’m feeling, (we live on opposite sides of the country but text everyday) only to be met with “yeah I feel like that sometimes too, proper sucks doesn’t it?”. 

Is it just me who wants to shake someone, anyone and yell at them until they realise how bad things have got for me? Cause I have tried everything and I am going backwards at this point.

My own fucking laugh isn’t even genuine anymore. Nothing is genuine. Nothing even feels like me. I’ve been mentally buried from depression and now this person who I haven’t seen in 3 years wants to hang out with me without realizing I’m not even a semblance of the person I used to be?! Like maybe years before, I could be fake and socially serve the interests of others, but now I just don’t give a fuck about human connection or contact at all outside from my mom and my husband- I know it’s pathetic but they were the only people who chose to stay around these 9 years.

All my friends don't talk to me anymore, I just lock myself in the god damn stalls at lunch time. I'm just so damn weird. Literally if you try talking to me I'm just so damn awkward like I been isolated on an island for a decade or something.
I made a bunch a goals like a month ago, if you're living with a narcissistic dad it makes it a shitload harder, I'm restricted in what I can do so I failed there. I'm in a very catch 22 situation in my home life.

"I can't remember what normal people do when they're home. Like, I just kind of lay in bed most of the time. 

I got home from work today and just ate a tuna lunch pack and drank a white claw tallboy before crawling into bed to kind of mindlessly doze off for a few hours. I graduated from this course thing that I needed for work a few days ago, but, I don't feel proud or accomplished at all. I just kinda feel sad and more anxious than I had felt during the course.

This pattern of behavior has been going on for so long now (think a few years) that I forget how abnormal it is. Like, most of the people with my job have similar shitty habits, so, it's difficult to really get an outside perspective on how obviously fucked what I'm doing is.

As a side note, I take pretty decent care of myself otherwise. Have a physically healthy lifestyle, apart from the over-sleeping and occasional over-eating. I don't have a social life or social support system to speak of , really. I've had a lot of very temporary associations for a while now. No one to spend enough time getting to know in order for them to be friends.

In summary, I guess, is this as bad as I think it might be? It feels pretty hopeless and lonely, day in day out. I'm a little worried that I might be staring down a slippery slope without really seeing it due to the echo chamber I'm generally surrounded by.",1
"I'm writing this while my parents are both both in the same room trying to punish me and torment me and I've head back as me tears as I fucking could with the occasion flow that I couldn't control based on what I'm writing and to them it was just their Friday afternoon entertainment
I fucking can't keep going anymore. Any time I have something descent happen to me, my parents are there to mock me and make me want to die. I want just end my suffering along and others. I will do more good by killing my self to me and others around me then I would if I was breathing. My parents have straight up told me I'm an accident and heavily imply that I somehow survived a condom and I'm a failed apportion. I'm treated like shit while my younger sister has the same respect as a goddess. She's threatened my life with a knife up to my neck and they find it normal. She steps on them like door mats calling them bitchs and they are all happy with that, and I go to talk to them with my full respect about my future and the laugh at subjects I want to do for a levels and I get fucking laughed at and made like a joke calling me retard because I can't read because I'm dislexic. Sometimes I feel like ending it right then and there, and I've had to hide it for so long, it's gotten to the point where people that I've know scence I was 6 can no longer tell wtf is going on. My parents are both extremely religious and I am too because if had no faith I wouldn't be righting this rn, so it's only more pain full when they call me demonic or I am possessed by a demon. It makes me fell like I've committed war crimes. They make me feel like they would of preferred Hitler as their first born.
The only asset I am to them is that I am a status symbol for their life, ""Hey guys we have a son and dose well in skool."" Even then if they have my sister for that. I'm forced to get an 8 (A+) in all my test as a minimum to satisfy their bear minimum requirements and if I don't I go through so much shit. I have stoped telling them about tests and everything else that is going in my life even tho we life in the same building.
I am truly finding a lack of resones for me to continue. All I have is a couple YouTubers and shows along with music and gaming and Im holding on for the little faith that I have that God has something for me, and if you take away some of those factors I have no self reson for my live. I've been threatened by other students to tell some teachers and I am scared about that outcome if that happens even though teachers have seen me stab my hand and arm in their classes untill the bleed - I think the real reason I'm scared is they would have to tell my parents that I am suicidal which would lead to them saying that a demonic and the devil is possessing me.
Thank you to you if you've had it here because you truly have cared for me the most in my life. I thank you with the bottom of Hart .",1

"I'm 15, and my whole last year has been really hard and depressing (got dumped by my gf, my cat died, my grandma went to hospital, my best friend almost died). I've managed to go through, and I've been fine for the last months. 

Suddenly my mom died. I was beginning again. I was good for once in a fucking while. And life decided to punch me again in that infernal spiral. I don't know what to do anymore. I have no mental health left.",1
"So I was just about to start a sewing project and I kinda felt excited, but then I felt so worthless and like a failure. I couldn't find a piece to the machine and I got a bit frustrated. Then I just felt like everything used on me was a waste, electricity, light the damned air. Usually when I feel down I just binge some show to stop me thinking about all that. But today was so sudden and I keep recalling some memories I'd rather not have. Like old classmates, which I thought I had managed to pack away and forget the memories of. I just wish I never had to face people in my life. I like to talk to people when I don't know how they look and who they are. I feel like I made a mistake making friends. I don't want people that know about me. I keep thinking what they will think once I have turned my back. Am I really that ugly, unfashionable and childish? The thing is nothing of what I have been through is hard. So I don't know why everything goes so dark every so often and I just want to sleep to stop thinking.
I just really wanted to sew something today

"I pretty consistently fluctuate between neutral for a couple days, happy for a day, and depressed for a solid week since I moved out to go to uni. At the moment I’m in a numb phase.

In these depressed periods I complain a lot on group chats, forgo social opportunities, and generally act a bit shitty towards normal people. Then I can’t even bear to read what I’ve said once I’m fine again. Not that it’s bad, just that I am embarrassed I shared my emotions. It’s no secret that people get uncomfortable if you vent.

I’m tired of this and I don’t know how to feel. I’ve been drinking a lot recently and there’s a 50/50 chance it either helps or makes it worse. Kinda stuck here.

"having autism and hating yourself alot for it sometimes? no biggie

trust issues from bullying and never having anyone stand up for you? its nothing

having your parents divorce, your grandfather passing away and your mom being out of work all at the same time at age 10? nothing at all

having no one there for you to support you through all that and having your emotions constantly invalidated? never heard of her

having your father emotionally abuse you trying to convince you that your mom hates you and gaslighting you and guilt tripping you for not talking to your grandmother who was a bitch to my entire family? couldn't ever happen

being badly mistreated by teachers and administrators and being called a problem? they could never!

Its something that truly has kept me here. The goals are never ending. If you are really having a hard time, try it? Even if you don't have kids. Think of any future event that will help you. I hope this makes sense. Its hard to explain with words but makes sense in my head.",1

Like, say you vent to a friend- then it's like, it becomes their burden to deal with.

"""Migraine""

Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone

I-I-I I've got a migraine
And my pain will range from up, down, and sideways
Thank God it's Friday
'Cause Fridays will always be better than Sundays
'Cause Sundays are my suicide days
I don't know why they always seem so dismal
Thunderstorms, clouds, snow, and a slight drizzle
Whether it's the weather or the letters by my bed
Sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head
Let it be said what the headache represents
It's me defending in suspense
It's me suspended in a defenseless test
Being tested by a ruthless examinant
That's represented best by my depressing thoughts
I do not have writer's block
My writer just hates the clock
It will not let me sleep, I'll get some sleep when I'm dead
And sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head

Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone
But I know we've made it this far, kid
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I am not as fine as I seem, pardon
Me for yelling, I'm telling you green gardens
Are not what's growing in my psyche, it's a different me
A difficult to be, stop feasting lumber-down trees
Freeze frame please, let me paint a mental picture portrait
Something you won't forget, it's all about my forehead
And now it is a door that holds back contents
That make Pandora's Box's contents look non-violent
Behind my eyelids are islands of violence
My mind ship-wrecked
This is the only land my mind could find
I did not know it was such a violent island
Full of tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions
They're trying to eat me, blood running down their chin
And I know that I can fight or I can let the lion win
I begin to assemble what weapons I can find
'Cause sometimes to stay alive you gotta kill your mind

i am a 17 year old boy, life is so so boring now, i am constantly beated mercilessly by my parents, i am not respected by my friends, always got bullied as a child and mocked by peers now, i have no respect from others, i dont think i am worthy to live anymore, all i do in life is just struggle, i want to just die, i always try to survive in this world, i am not alive anymore, all my dreams are now broken, all i see is a future where i will never have friends or a loving family nor a loving girlfriend or wife ever, i wish i can just lay down at peace

i dont even laugh anymore, nothing, literally nothing can make me laugh now, even the things i find funny dont make me laugh, i am an ugly coward who is, and always since day 1, was used by others and belittled to the very bottom, i am scared, i dont wanna live anymore

but still i see my family, idk why.... any help ? so that i can become better ? 

otherwise giving up is my last option, will life be great one day ? well i dont think so because i dont believe in god, there is no magic, maybe i was meant for this, a life where i could be used up and thrown with little to no attention given... all i can do is crib like a loser here.... i try becoming better but then others push me down, i dont have any self confidence left, i dont like myself, i just want to give up, shall i do it ? or if not, please suggest some sensible suggestions that can be used in life practically

What I am asking is: Did I self inflict and perpetuate my lack of self worth as a kid and throughout life? Is it possible that no amount of love or nurturing would have been enough to prevent this? Is it possible that I was and am too sensitive. That I did this to myself? That something is just wrong with me and I'm creating my own problems?",1

Its not reason enough anymore, I've dont many friends and ive never been in a relationship.

I can almost feel my body and my brain just slowly giving up and shutting down. I've tried therapy and medication but I dont feel like its ever had any real effect.

Like what is actually wrong with me, I've been going through this never ending loop of being numb and then overwhelmed by everything. When I'm numb I feel so detached from who I am, everyone around me and sometimes struggle to even feel real. And while all this is happening I can't stop thinking that any day now I'm going to end right back into the overwhelmed stage where everything I've suppressed or haven't dealt with just comes over me all at once and life just gets impossible to deal with, this is when all the dark thoughts come and I want to just end it all.

Like i wouldn't say that I'm suicidal but it's like I'd be okay with dieing. Like it's just been such a long journey where all I remember is being stuck in this place, so how am I exspected to feel or get any better....

After that I felt that I don't have anyone anymore, but I met a girl with similar problems, we started talking, she took care of me, I felt wonderful and I felt that I finally have a purpose in life, I learned a lot from her and the fact that it can be considered as a simple teenage love and I will meet someone else, but two weeks ago she cheated on me with some guy.Until now I'm broken, the emptiness inside me kills me because I know that I don't trust anyone else, only her. I know that I don't trust anyone anymore, only her. Despite this, we continued to write and even arranged a meeting, but she stood me up, she apologized, but then everything was breaking inside of me, then she started posting pictures with her new boyfriend and how they kiss, then I realized that I feel that this is the end, everything lost its meaning, the passions that once drove me completely lost my attention. The person I was involved with for 3 years and we had a lot in common left me, my family doesn't give a shit about me, I don't have any friends.Nothing keeps me here anymore and anyone who thinks that maybe I'll find someone is wrong, I haven't and I never will, and I feel sorry for the rest of people like me, now I understand what it's like.Please, after what I want to do, people should finally understand that it destroys people and they need fucking help, any kind of help.Peace, love and empathy, please, just for fuck sake people need it.",1

I suddenly burst into tears and told her that I tolerate so much stress every single day that I feel like I'm going insane, and the fact that I don't feel close to my parents or anyone so that I can open up to them and so on, then I talked for a few more minutes and she also talked to me a little, and then told me that she thinks I have anxiety and depression and I have to do a test. (It was a 90 question test, asking about my symptoms) and I got a score of 83 out of 100, so she gave me medication for depression and anxiety, and all this happened in like 40 minutes in total. 
So what do you think? Can a psychiatrist diagnose someone in that much time? 
I mean I already knew that I have depression and SAD and it was very obvious for a doctor to notice this while I was talking but still I'm a little uncertain if I she could diagnose me well in such a short time and also give me medication.

Knowing that I have a purpose here in this universe and having to know what that is; it’s a daunting task.

Knowing what family I have and to look forward to the predictable/unpredictable future family.

"I have been experiencing weird symptoms which I think are peripheral hallucinations? It started probably about half a year ago. At first they were happening about once a month but now they’ve increased to about once a week. To explain, I see something (out of the corner of my eye) such as hands coming out of the wall, sinister looking people sitting next to me and staring at me, people looking at me through the window, people’s feet walking beside me when I am walking down the street, and today probably the worst yet, a decapitated head. When it happens my heart beats really fast and I start panicking. When I look to see if it’s real there’s nothing there, sometimes an inanimate object which doesn’t resemble a person or body part at all. I also had one incident where two people were walking behind me on the street and I became paranoid because I couldn’t tell if they were real or not.

I suffer from anxiety and depression and I’ve been having a lot of work stress after starting a new graduate role 2 months ago. This could be related to the increase in hallucinations

I open this page in the same way I open the fridge when you have a little bit of food but don’t like any of it. Here a few minutes ago…expecting a changed feeling…

There’s so many of us and there’s not enough validation that we all seek.

I tried commenting on multiple posts before, so that I can fulfill the balance of comments left by me… vs comments others leave me…

And I can’t help but feel it’s instill unsustainable and unfair. You beautiful people didn’t ask for this.

Not all but some of you have even been f***ed over with the ability to imagine something uniquely human, suicide.

You were given no choice in being birthed into a world that required you to put in an insane amount of effort, and you cannot check out. Mainly because of your survival instinct, that you once again did not choose to have. But also because if not for your depression you would be able to see suicide isn’t an option. Did you ask for that blindfold? No, you didn’t.

Just shouting into the void because I think I just saw someone in there holding a candle light…

How do we connect to each other? 

I wish there was a way we could all be in the same room. I think if I wasn’t so alone I wouldn’t be so hopeless. I know this isn’t the case for everyone. Some people here are in borderline catatonic states and need doctors, while some of you may have slipped into a catatonic state and no longer interact with us because of that.

But there has to be a way for us to be connected and suffer together if we are forced to suffer.

I have a dream of opening something up, but since I have such a hard time finding hope for the next day, I spend most of my energy keeping myself from going insane it seems.

I want to open up a library that’s open 24 hours. A beautiful cozy one where people can meet each other or just enjoy each other’s company while they battle through their work from home job, or their online classes, which is now bearable because they are surrounded by life and a constant reminder of the beautiful society they contribute to. Almost like the way we humans were meant to live. In tribes, and if not moving side by side, connected at the very least.

Every now and then in this cozy library I’d smile at a stranger, because I know people like to be individually thought of, and I imagine this would give them strength and warmth.

Maybe telling you guys this was the same reason you all write here, to give your offering to the void and hope some spirit reads it.

I feel a little warmer now. Come closer, boy with the candle…

"It's friday night and I've got nothing going on in my life so thought I'd ask some fellow depressed people how you deal with boredom.

Everything is so f\*cking boring, I go to work and put on this happy and ambitious mask, but in reality I'm bored out of my mind every single day of the week. The only thing I look forward to during the workweek is the weekend, but once I actually reach the weekend I wonder what the h\*ll I was looking forward to. Was I really looking forward to sitting in this cold and empty apartment all weekend getting shitfaced by myself? Iv'e come to conclude that one of my major problems is that I'm in a constant state of boredom, nothing is interesting, nothing is fun, no-one that I want to talk to. The only thing that keeps me sane is eating unhealthy food, drinking alcohol and taking sedatives to reach a near coma-like sleep. I watch mindless videos to try and forget how dull everything is, but every time I turn off the video or go to make food I realise how f\*cking empty my life is.

"Hi everyone, this is my first time posting in this group so please delete if this post isn’t allowed.. My partner and I are currently struggling financially due to the pandemic with job changes and job losses which has caused my mental health to plummet as a result… I suffer with bipolar type 1, severe anxiety, severe depression alongside psychosis and panic disorder so working is already a hassle for me…. Our fur baby is currently on a prescription diet as our vet informed us at our last visit that they’ve found crystals in his urine… We’ve asked if there’s any chance we could potentially switch back to his old, cheaper food and they quickly informed us that switching back could be fatal to him… I feel so embarrassed and afraid to ask strangers on the internet for help but im at my wits end.. 😓 This sub has helped me through so much so I felt comfort coming here… we are both in our early 20’s and just starting to get our lives together and I feel like such a failure as a cat mom… His food is $30 and a little over $40 with shipping and handling… Anything will help! Even a prayer ❤️‍🩹😓thank you all again so much and I can send photo proof to anyone who may want/need it

"M(30), health anxiety, OCD, depression, SAD, ADHD. A bit of background: I’m currently having a lot of health anxiety. I’ve had this for a few years and my latest bout is sending me down the “I’m going to die” hole again. I’ve had this multiple times over the past few years and I also get incredibly sad/upset/anxious thinking of my imminent demise. Anyway, I was walking yesterday because I couldn’t work or focus on anything. I started breaking down as I was walking because I was pleading with the universe to tell me I was going to be fine and to carry on. Right after, I thought how I just want to be taken care of so badly. And right after that, like a tidal wave, I realized I felt like I was never taken care of as a child. Loved, safe - yes. But taken care of, no. I also realized I’ve been deeply sad since probably around 10 years old, however I’ve had my suspicions about this for a while... This all hit me at once and it felt quite undeniable. It’s all very confusing and painful. A lot of things seem sad when I look back, of course there have been wonderful moments of pure happiness and bliss-fullness in my life. I just think the bad has been more tremendous than I ever realized. I came home and explained this to my wonderful fiancé and completely broke down. I just want someone to tell me everything is going to be okay. I don’t know if I ever got that as a child. Anyway—a bit of a ramble now!
Wondering if anyone else has ever thought or felt like this before?
Thank you! 🙏🏼",1
"Shame is making me want to isolate
Making me want to withdraw
Say nothing
Hide behind hair and baggy clothes
And I feel myself succumbing
Like I'm already fully in it's grip
And I don't want to fight it
Because I feel like I should withdraw, say less, take up as little space as I can
Because I get drunk and excited
And say things and do things that make me feel embarrassed when I think of them sober the day after

And him. I think of him constantly. I crave intimacy. I desire to lay beside him. Feel his warmth next to me. Feel his soft hair. The comforting smell of his breath. The center of everything. It's him. It's always him. And we can't anymore because he doesn't want to. Which is understand and is fine. It just hurts. How I wish. How I long. But I'm learning to accept it. And he's so kind. There for me in the midst of it. I'm diminishing under his gaze. I tense up and feel see through everytime he looks at me. Like I have to avert my eyes and I just want to dissapear completely. And he's done nothing to cause such a reaction. It's just me feeling extremely self conscious in front of him. 

And if this is a side affect of being in love with him. Not in love. Not in love with anyone. In love with HIM. Then I'll endure it. I don't care. Because even though it hurts, the affection I feel for him is better than anything I've ever felt.",1
"#### tldr
I've been taking weekly group language classes since 2020 - initially they were in person, now they're online. Lately the whole topic is making me feel more and more worthless, instead of exciting me. I'm struggling to decide what to do. My state of mind suggests to stop the weekly classes, whilst logically I feel it should be a way to feel better.

---

Struggled with mental health for ever, thought to join a class to get some human interaction as I don't have a social circle, and introduce some regularity and structure in my life since I have none.

Even though the lessons themselves are fine and somewhat fun, I feel horrific and very avoidant even until the very second before I join the room. Language learning in general is a bit depressing because I feel that I need to talk/connect with people to improve, but that is the single biggest struggle of my life in connecting with people.

It might be better to just force myself through (5 weeks left) because there are students that I've studied with since the start, and had the same teacher. If I were to drop out then I would lose those familiar faces... And additionally I wouldn't have any compulsion to complete the weekly homework (last minute...) or wake up at a regular time on Saturday (my sleeping schedule breaks every week).

"So diagnosed with psychotic depression, might be schizoaffective disorder. Best and only friend died 18months ago. Had a nice hospital visit after trying to kill myself cos I thought everyone was telling me to. My wife has just left me whilst I’m tapering off antipsychotics. My question is what the fuck do I do now?
I have no support system where I am, no friends to talk to, just a dog. I can work remotely and just want to get away from it all. I have a little savings to do so. Kicking around the idea of becoming a digital nomad. Where do I go? What should I do? Any opinions?",1

However, I just couldn't bring myself to fill them in. I felt as though there was no point and I was just doing it for nothing. I now VERY MUCH regret this and I'm honestly not sure what to do.

"I never really got any meaningful advice that I couldn't get from reddit, honestly

It was more the facade of it I enjoyed, that I was in a *safe space* and could get feelings out [except not really cause if I sounded too sad they can just call the cops]

the whole idea of entrusting your deepest feelings to some woman feels a bit...invasive as well",1
"Understanding and examining have started becoming oblivious to me. I've been programming for five years or even little more and I was great with it. I could compherend complex or unusual *unknown* things by examination and ""touching"" it. I was feeling quite unique comparing to others because of the way I quickly learn stuff. That helped me withstand and search information. That did not last long.

Now I've forgotten much of knowledge and pattern matching, analyzing stuff has become really difficult. That even escalated to the degree that I can barely understand what does documentation or specification or a damn guide say even though it was rather easy well before, or at least adequate. I also have memory problems, I only memorize with lot of effort. With that along, writing text has become much harder in both English and my native language. It is really hard to type all this with keeping information about what I want to say.

And the main problem is that this everything combined pushes me onto frustration and depression as I have already harmed myself with a pencil by piercing my hand badly and I see no future with these problems. Once I felt myself good, coming back to ground is killing me. Not only my current quite abstract plans for my life are destroyed but also any possible life-plotting is. I am too young, I had a whole life in front of me.

I have visited a neurologist since I have troubles with both sight and thinking and I'm going for few more observations. Also I was given some medication for stabilizing my emotion stance as to not neither damage myself nor others for now.

Is life worth to live it as a forever-noob understanding that you have once been good? I see only suffering and suffering, step by step to quiet suicide of society's heavy burden reason. No one will help me right then as no one wills to work with someone who always wants (or pretends) to be good but in fact is disabled to learn.

I'll try to refine this text if something is misunderstood.",1

"I've been self-harming for two nights in a row now. Currently have a bandage on my arm. They are mostly shallow cuts, so it's not like I tried to kill myself. 

I barely have an appetite, and when I eat, I feel guilty afterwards. 

I'm not in a good place mentally and been trying to numb it all with Klonopin. 

I spoke to my therapist and he says I need to go to a hospital so a psychiatrist can see me ASAP, as I jave a history of suicide attempts (though I shluld reiterate, I'm not trying to kill myself at the moment).

I'm just scared that they see me and want to take ke to a psych ward again and cram meds down my throat that simply don't work. I feel like my days in psych wards are spent in a daze.

I don't like them because I feel a bit isolated and I can't do a lot of things I enjoy, like video games. I know it sounds shallow, but I don't know.

Should I go to the hospital to get checked out anyway? The cuts are really shallow, and honestly, not eating much and taking (a little too much) klonopin doesn't seem like a big deal.",1
"For some reason this question makes me unreasonably angry. What is the proper response?

"I’m consistently the butt of jokes amongst my ‘friend group’ if I can even call it that.

We argue a lot over significant and insignificant things but it’s normally because I get emotionally worked up.

I get reprimanded by my supervisors or by my parent and i feel it. I sit alone with my thoughts for more than 10 minutes and i feel it. I get paralyzed by my adhd and the fact that i cant take action debilitated me more, and i feel it. It’s like a wave of chemicals pour over my body, and i feel warm, and it feels like there’s little explosions in my chest and then my heart starts beating loud and erratically, and my mouth feels dry. I know this is something many people with anxiety experience, but i feel like it happens so often i fear it could actually wear down my heart. Maybe the worst part is that I wish my heart would actually fail.",1

I eat to escape hunger, work, I read, play video games, watch movies, and so on... To prevent the ache of boredom, although these things already bore me. Sleeping is the only thing I truly like. I fantasise about the day when I will sleep and never wake up, but it is a fantasy in and of itself.

I'll do it at some point, and I can't wait; I don't know how or when it will happen, but I know it will be soon, because I can't tolerate being alive any longer, and I wish I had done it years ago.",1

"First sorry for my bad language I think i will killmyself if my situation is the same in 10 years
I feel like my life is already ruined, everything is boring the things i liked before are no longer good only videogames and music made my mind empty but im not happy so people told me to fond new hobbies and i did that like playing piano guitar and the rectangle that cowboy used but i quickly stopped because i had zero motivation to do it, it was boring.
This year i told myself that i will work at school, make new friends and be happy but its not the case i only make new friends and i love them but when im back home its like usual i have zero motivation and i go to sleep really early And i have a question, does love comes in life naturaly because last time i fell in love was 6 years ago and i never loved another girl since that time.
I see my friends having real relationships or at least a crush but not me, if i have to seek for love i think i will be single forever. I dont know if they really think that or its just to be polite but they say im good looking but the problem is that im really really shy and people says that because of my height and face im intimidating (i dont know if its the correct word sorry) so i dont think most people want to talk to me.
And i have nothing to say too i only play videogames sleep and eat.
I tought that having the love of someone and love someone will help me but im not sure and in any case nobody wants me",1
"Obligatory no I didn't cheat.

Can't say much more than the title says. I'm slowly going insane I literally do nothing and feel so useless. Sorry for the low effort post but atleast just typing it out feels really good. Hope you all are doing better, if you ever love someone hold then and don't let them go, trust me........

Why put this on the internet? I don't fucking know I just have actually nobody else I feel comfortable talking to this about, not even my best friends, parents, or siblings, so atleast here I can just throw it out there.

Worst part is that when we broke up I had a life changing epiphany and cut off all my problems cold turkey (miserable 2 weeks btw) and within the first 2 weeks and they were gone and haven't resurfaced once since. But I'm scared the lonelyness and isolation are only going to push me back into the same toxic mindset I was in, not because I feel it coming on but because I know from the past im susceptible to those things. I know that if we were to be together again that my last remaining issues would be solved since they're only related to our breakup, but I couldn't live with myself if I felt like I convinced her back into something that she didn't want in her life, but the devil on the shoulder says if I do nothing and don't talk to her for the next 6-12 months I am putting the nail in the coffin into a relationship with a girl I genuinely believe is my soul mate. As shown above my emotions are a roller coaster but for some reason month four is the hardest by far, I can't sleep, eat, work, or gain any morivation. I hate that it took losing her to realize it but I can only blame myself I feel so much shame.

These thoughts arent usually constant throughout the day but when they hit they hit hard, especially recently during the 4 month mark. I just have infinite love for this girl and my mental state overshadowed that to the point of no return and now that I've fixed it I can't feel anything on the topic but just sit here. She also just left for a college that is deemed a party College and I can't help but overthink every single night were apart.

FINAL: I know this was written in a terrible format and was all over the place. I am writing this from an overwhelmed state of mind not knowing what to think. Thank you if made it this far it means a hell of a lot more than you will even know....

I still have hope...",1

I almost search and rearrange my past just to see if i am awful and deserve this. The other half is self loathing and hate for letting my ex leave,so many chances i could have saved it and i didnt. There used to be noise every day. We woudlnt even go to the store alone. Now its just silence. Im alone and i hear my thoughts now.

"So I (31f) was officially diagnosed with severe depression and moderately severe anxiety almost a year ago (although I’ve known I’ve had both since maybe 12ish) but I’ve been going to therapy and I’ve learned a lot of coping skills and have the ability to recognize my unhelpful thinking and all that jazz. And I would say I’m pretty self aware. But I just feel tired of feeling the way I do. As a general context I’ve suffered a lot of trauma and abuse in my childhood and a lot of family issues. I feel worthless all the time and as if I need to apologize for my existence. Which I know logically I’m not worthless, but I don’t know how to get out of the cycle of thought patterns. There’s a lot of other stuff but, all that to say, I’m debating asking my therapist about taking meds.

"So, I got a new bike this Monday after being a year without one because it got stolen. I was so excited to get to ride it, but I was wondering why it felt so boring still. I had been excited for the bike for quite some time, and cycling has always been my thing. I felt depressed, even, after the first few rides. I realized it was because I don't have my best friend anymore. 

My depression convinced me she's better off without me, so I ended the friendship of 7+ years. Part of me still wishes she would have convinced me to stay, it kind of hurts to think how she didn't, especially when she knows about my depression and how it often made me shut people out. I still wish I didn't end it, but I'm too afraid to ask her if we can still be friends.

Anyway, she used to go cycling with me most of the time when I'd ask her if she wanted to. I now feel even emptier without her in my life, but I know she's moved on, at least much more than I have. I basically have no friends left, she has plenty. I only have one friend I occasionally talk to over text, but I haven't seen them in forever since they moved.

I often wonder if she misses and thinks about me as much as I do. She's been on my mind every week. It's been over 6 months since I last hung out with her. I don't understand how I let myself get so bad that I ended the friendship when she meant so much to me. I was so sure that we'd last forever.",1
"I started my college offline couple days ago. I'm doing what I wanted to do, what was at one point my passion, I've fought with my family to be here.

I feel so goddamn ugly that I could put a knife through my face right now. I want to like cut off my stomach. I barely eat anything, still I keep my weight on cause of this stupid fking pcos. I hate me so fking much right now. Call me superficial but I also want the feeling of confidence in my looks enough to aproach people or get approached.

But beyond that, I get pushed to the background and am too pathetic to come up front again. Wtf am I supposed to do. I've listened to most of the common advice, like taking walks, talking to people, exercise, fking evrything, but nothing sticks, and I still hate myself everytime I see myself.

"I used to have good memories about Thanksgiving and Christmas since my family tried to get along then. This is the first year where I won't be going home to see them since we recently moved to another state and there's even more tension than usual, so I'm probably going to be alone or semi-alone for them for the first time in my life. Everything just feels darker than normal which is already pretty dark, and I want things to just be okay. Does anyone else struggle with this? How do you get through that pit of feeling unwanted and alone and empty?",1
"I do not feel that I am worthy of being depressed and many people seem to believe so. I have excellent school grades (top 0.1% in my state/province/county/country), I have a caring family and my family isn't part of the uber-rich but we have enough surplus to lead a comfortable life. From this roster, I believe I should be satisfied and that I should somehow be happy, and that I should not be sad. The idea that a fking elitist prick like me can get depression is really fking absurd. But here I am, the person that my whole fking conservative Christian chruch hates the most: a fking rich, white, bisexual, libtard who should honestly shut up and listen to other people's problems. I have no outlet to rant because whatever I rant would make me look like a freaking asshole and honestly, I have an image to uphold in real life. Therefore, I am using this throwaway account to really get all these pent-up emotions out there.

I hate myself for who I am. I feel like I am spoiled by my parents due to my upbringing and that I am incapable of taking care of anyone, even myself. Because of this, I feel like I will never be able to be loved by anyone or capable of loving anyone else. But yet, I crave belonging amongst my friends because I don't have many friends and must treasure the few around me. However, I have a constant fear that one day they would see how terrible of a person I am and truly leave me alone, just as I always had been. My friends have an inkling of an idea of my problems but I dare not share with them more, for fear of causing them to leave me forever. 

One of my closest confidants is this girl. She has gone off to college and with her not speaking to me on the regular basis, which she has every right to do since college has a busy schedule, I feel like I would crash and burn soon. What complicates matters is I really like this girl very much and we are really very similar people but I feel like I would never be able to take care of her and thus have given up even bothering to beg for her affections. Additionally, I don't think we would ever make it since we both have dreams and I can't for the life of me ask her to sacrifice her dreams for mine. Deep down, I would really love to give up my dreams to help her set up her own business...but I don't feel worthy of her at all because I have extremely low self-esteem.

Additionally, recently I feel like my own cognitive ability is waning, either due to a lack of sleep or due to being conscripted to the military. I am unable to retain the information I have read or heard seconds ago. I am unable to study for my college course in the future or prepare for the interviews coming up. I feel sleepy all the time. I have been feeling fatigued at work. The good thing is I have made a lot of friends in my current unit in the military. They are good people. However, I know that the same anxiety of losing them would come welling up very soon.

To give you some context as to why I don't share extensively about my problems, last last year, my own teacher started to rant to me about how a student he was dating did not reciprocate his feelings and they have broken up. They were making some art piece together and then somehow the guy he was dating's parents thought that my teacher has turned him gay and thus forbade them from ever meeting again. Then they had some argument. Then the teacher threatened suicide and the student's friend called the police on him. Then, last year, he started calling me at 1 am in the morning, at least twice per week, in order to cry to me about how he wants the guy to talk to him again. That year was the year I was taking my final exams. After that, out of nowhere, he started ranting about his sex life to me. Rant about how he wasnt getting any sex from the student even though supposedly the student was fking every single guy in my school. He insinuated, from reading conversations I had with the student, that this student is somehow trying to sexually groom me to be his next fktoy, which gave me constant fear that I was somehow gonna be raped in an alley or sth. Although I really wanted to help him out of this difficult bit, his problems have weighed me down emotionally. Therefore, I do not wish to do unto others what he did unto me.

Additionally, going parallel to this, I was in a relationship that went on for too long. It was new for both of us and therefore, we made mistakes. I think I was gaslighted by the girl unintentionally. However, I was not sure whether I wasn't doing the same to her. I felt like I was incapable of being loved and incapable of loving others too from then on.

And then, there are the tragedies. My grandmother died last last year. I didn't shed a tear while my dad was crying like a baby. My primary school classmate committed suicide this year. I didn't shed a tear either and didn't even bother showing up to his funeral. I know I should feel sad and terrible for these losses but I couldn't bring myself to cry. I don't feel human. I don't deserve to be human. I wonder whether I am going to cry or even feel sad at my parent's funeral.

Of course, I dread the future that I am going to live in. Humans never change. We are either going to drive ourselves to an apocalypse due to economic collapse, environmental disasters, nuclear war or simply a disease. I have given up on human beings. The world is going to end and when that really happens, I am going to just laugh.

My church tries to reach out to me sometimes. I ignore them. They would just tell me to snap out of it and throw at me some Bible verses and leave. They know how I think about the world, the ideals of a libtard, and I don't expect them to enjoy my company. If they knew I wasn't even straight, they would yeet me out of the church. I mean our church literally passed a policy to bar LGBTQ+ personnel from even stepping foot in the church. I don't dare tell them I wasn't straight because that would also cause my mother to lose her career in the church. She disagrees with their conservative views but has enough love in her to look past that and serve them well as a minister. I don't want to take away this source of joy for her.

I will enjoy my front seat of this rollercoaster straight down to hell. Straight into the most bottom ring of hell I go.",1
"Lmao she has no idea how hateful I am. Given the chance and knowing I can get away with it, I will steal, cheat, lie, deceive, and manipulate for my own advantage. I DO NOT care about other humans. They can all go die and I do not care, it’s so funny how she thinks my sadness is some sort of relativity to her.

She’s actually is so dumb and doesn’t know what she’s doing. I just talk to her cause I have no one else, but she doesn’t know what she’s talking about, nor does she know what she’s doing. She’s clueless about everything. Such young mine, yet so easily decidable. I don’t want to start with any other person, so I don’t leave.",1

The worst part is today my parents did it just because I called 2 guys and 2 girls at my place to study after asking them. Just cause my door was closed they said the filthiest stuff ever cause my neighbor questioned why does she have boys coming at her house. This is not what triggers, the fact that my parents don't trust me, the fact that I am judged by my every move..hurts I am so done I just can't anymore it hurts every vein every beat and every breath. I tried suiciding before I tried everything therapy everything nooooo it hurts they don't get it no one does. I feel useless I feel broken I feel judged I feel dead inside.  I just can't do it anymore.",1

The more I think about it, why just me dead? It’s not my fault, everyone is to blame not me. I didn’t chose to be this way, it’s all their fault for putting me down and calling me things. If anything, they should all die and I should make sure. Why should I die? I did nothing wrong. I was kind and respectful even when getting mad fun of. 

It blows my mind how others who are mean and disrespectful get good stuff to them. Things that I could only dream of and me? No, i get screwed and denial all those things. Knowing I would be better at them. I really don’t get it, yet I know why things are like that and the reason why is disappointing, cause it’s not something you can really change about yourself. You’re either born that way or
You’re not. Nothing else can be done. Sad reality.",1
"As in Dark Souls the Curse of Want ravished the age of gods and furthered itself to many ages to come, here I stand cursing my lack of wisdom even though I sit in a 'blessed' place on the intelligence scale. How I envy the blissful ignorance of those who don't know any better and can't help but trust better days await. I feel burdened by knowing where we are headed in a collective scale, the disproportionate amount of control the public believes the state has and the actual state of affairs. I find myself in a desperate search to recover what I once held as most valuable as a child. I agree it's not about the destination, but what if the destination is you. To recover oneself and reignite zest for striving, living without second thought. Dancing alongside the ripples of fate like a limitless bird. I might already have what I seek. 

Why doesn't that realization help? 

Do I consider it a lie? 

If so, how bad of a lie is it in comparison to the artificial world people immerse themselves through screens? 

I like to think there are useful lies just as the existence of black truths. Matter is, my world is absolute gray.",1

I watch movies, I hear my own mom’s stories about her dad (my grandpa), he’s 80 and has dementia so he’s not like he used to be when my mom was young. He was loving and protecting. 
A father is supposed to be loving and protecting and sadly I filled that void with getting attached to my male psychiatrist. He is almost 70, but it really felt like I had someone who cared. He was with me through all my hospitalizations and sadly had a stroke and is in rehab now. Sometimes I’m jealous of his kids and grandkids because even as a doctor he was really caring and he knew my story with my father. 
I really wish I had a dad like him or my grandpa. It brings me to tears often. I don’t see my biological father as a dad, more like someone who I’m related to, a disgusting man, as my psychiatrist said “a predator and abuser”.",1

No, it most definitely is not just me, I'm just being self centred. Nothing about me is special. No one is born knowing what they wanna do but how the fuck do people find out what they wanna do? Did I miss the fucking memo? What the fuck even is passion?? Why does everything feel like nothing??

am i cursed for eternity?

i've been worse than this one time before, a couple years ago. but i never got help. i used other coping mechanisms like drinking and starving myself lol.

anyways i started seeing a therapist last week. we had 2 sessions so far. i have enough insurance for 7 sessions.

our first session left me really raw, i told her a lot of personal things i've never told anyone. but in our second session last night, she went in a totally different direction. we didn't really address any of my depression or eating issues or family issues we talked about in the first session. which felt weird to me since i really opened up to her. instead she wanted to talk about my job and career for the whole hour, which i did briefly mention was something i wasnt satisfied with, but i think i have a lot of bigger and more pressing issues. i feel like i barely got to talk about anything that was actually bothering me. 

i guess this got me wondering if therapy is even worth it? i feel like i paid $120 for someone to force me to complain about work for an hour. am i allowed to ask to talk about something else during my session? i felt like she had the whole thing planned out and i didnt want to be rude.

maybe i should try someone else? or should i stick it out and see where she takes it next time ? i just feel so shitty and i dont know how much longer i can go on feeling like this",1

So it seems outwordly. I have noticed lately that he is coming late to classes basically every morning since a few weeks now. Always with excuses like having overslept or that he missed his bus to the school. I also noticed that his grades have gone down in a few subjects. He often talks about that he is smoking a lot of weed lately and that he spends his time wich he should need to study with playing minecraft up until 2 am and then oversleeping the next morning. I know that the things going on in his life are none of my business, but Im worried about him. I often have the conclution that his happy behaviour is a coping mechanism for masking the stuff hes struggling with. Also one of my classmates made a comment to him about his oversleeping and he reacted in a very offended way. I dont know if offering him my help and that he can talk to me if he wants to makes him feel like me not believing in him and therefore taking his power to change. I want to empower him in some way that makes him feel like he can get back on track in a supporting way, but I dont really know how i can communicate that to him.

"Hi All,

I hope you're all doing well.

I'm coming here for help, because I really don't know what to do about how I feel anymore. 

I have had a long battle with depression from the age of about 13, and I'm 29 now. Over the last 18 months with remote working and COVID-19, I have felt increasingly low, and now I pretty much feel nothing.

I have zero motivation to do even the smallest tasks, I.E. showering, or going to the shops to grab groceries - but I never used to be like this. The people around me tell me to just ""get on up and do it"" as by doing it, I may feel better about it, but I can't even bring myself to get out of the house for a walk or go to the shops to grab groceries. It's almost like I've become somewhat agoraphobic as a result of being inside for the last 18 months.

I so desperately want to go back to a happier time, when I was social and outgoing, when I woke up everyday and put on my nice clothes and took care of myself. Most days I don't see it as a priority to even shower or brush my hair. 

I work full time, and my work hasn't suffered, because I think I see work as an escape for me to just forget about how I'm feeling for a short while - as a result, I'm working the hardest I've ever been because of the consistency, routine and knowing where I stand perhaps? I just don't know.

This ""thing"", is eating me up inside. Things I used to find enjoyable like art, candle making, horror movies are just nothing to me now. I find it tough to even be interested in a conversation with people but I have mastered the art in being able to put on a face whilst at work and then do nothing but feel like this every spare second I have. I don't even like speaking to my friends on the phone anymore, or going out to see people. I've gained a lot of weight (3st) and I just don't want to be seen, but I can't motivate myself to eat better or go to the gym. I can't win.

It's hard to describe how I feel, because I feel nothing. Nothing excites me, motivates me or engages me anymore. My personal relationships are suffering as a result because I just don't have it in me to push myself. It's as if there's me in the corner of the room at a party, with everyone else around them dancing and having fun and I just can't bring myself to get up and get involved - even though a part of me really wants to.

Does anyone have any advice here? I'm sorry for the melancholy post. Thank you in advance.",1
"Hello! New to Reddit, hope I've got this right!

I've been on Citalopram for about 3 years now, and about a year ago started on Elvanse for ADHD. I've recently been suffering with a bout of deep depression, and having real trouble sleeping. Mainly stress at work, bit I guess just a lot of stuff built up and caught me unawares. My GP switched my Citalopram out for Mirtazapine to help me sleep, about 2 months ago now, in which it has done wonders. However, it's to the point where I feel unable to wake most days and feel pretty drowsy for most of the day.

I take the Mirtazapine at about 6:30pm each evening and am very tired by around 9:30pm, usually asleep in bed by 10pm. I have a 7am alarm, but I've been struggling to get up any time before 8am. It takes me several hours each morning before I feel awake enough to function, and I'm quite grumpy first thing! I take my Elvanse the moment I get out of bed, and generally wash that down with a strong cuppa.

I have of course booked an appointment to speak to my GP again, but really wanted to see if other people had longer than average settling in periods for Mirtazapine. Is it worth persevering, or could it just not be for me? Really appreciate your thoughts, which I do of course understand are quite personal and may not be wholey applicable to my mind or body chemistry!",1
"Hi, sorry if my English is bad, but I need help.
I have had anxieties and depressions since the age of 18, today I am 26 years old.
Before that I had a perfect life as a child.
I have anxieties about being independent.
I am very dependent on my parents for everything.
I take psychiatric medications to ""balance"" myself, but that does not solve my problem.
I can't make money / find a job because when I start it awakens my anxiety and depression.
Same as find a relationship.
And Get out of the house and live alone.
Anything that makes myself an 'adult'.
I experienced many depressions that lasted for many months, and every time I am stressed or anxious, my stomach hurts and I have a strong desire to go to the bathroom.
I searched for such a problem on the internet and it does not seem that anyone is experiencing a specific problem like mine ...
I feel like a grain of dust in this whole huge universe. Meaningless. I have lost all faith I had, I can no longer believe in God and it makes it harder for me psychologically. I feel pointless.
All the people around me say I am talented and have the potential to do everything. But it's hard for me to deal with all this life. At the end of the day, I find myself playing computer games every day, because that's the only thing that helps me keep my head busy. I feel like time is burning and nothing is moving.

I feel like the stress and depression overrules what happiness I do have. I hate how it affects not only me but my family. A melancholy point of view is where my eyes and mind are stuck at.

I’ll try to keep it short. My girlfriend is suffering from what I believe is either ADHD, severe depression, anxiety or maybe all of the above. She started having problems with her mental health back in September which progressively worsened (eating less, low energy, motivation) which resulted in her hitting a breaking point, so she’s moving home next month. All I know and understand up to this point is that she’s just overwhelmed by living away from her friends/family/home. Snapchat is our default for communicating with each other. Always has been. She used to send pictures of her whole face or chatting my head off all day up until 3 weeks ago. Total opposite. We talk maybe once a day now; aside from me checking in on her, asking if she ate etc… I’ve talked with a few people about this already but they’ve never beeen in this particular instance. They’ve all told me to break up with her but I don’t want to because she’s honestly a great girl and I’m damn lucky to have her. Only one person I know had to deal with their so having major depression before so maybe I should ask her?
I’ve been reading about this lots believe me. I am trying my hardest to be the best support I can for her but I’m beginning to wonder if my efforts are amounting to anything. I’m uncertain if her depression is rubbing off on me or if I’ve created my own anxiety hamster in my brain. I do understand the best thing to do is just be there and be be supportive

I’ve been dealing with my depression for around 9 years now. I’ve had ups and downs and a handful of medical problems to go alongside it some being potentially life threatening if not taken care of. I always end up hiding or putting off medical problems till it physically stops me from doing everyday simple tasks. Apart of me is just hoping one of my medical issues just puts the nail on the coffin for me so I don’t have to ponder if it gets better or not. I’ll finally get closures to it. I know all the basic pep talks and I have tried handful of methods to better myself nothing seems to of helped. I also seem to have no motivation to better myself in life to top everything off. I haven’t told anybody of hopefulness that something will do me in but I think if it doesn’t do it I’ll eventually do it. I’ve started seeing a doctor for my current medical problem and I’m not in any immediate danger. I honestly feel out of options and I’m slowly seeking anything that may help that I haven’t tried.,1
"**a VERY long post, but a VERY worthy one I promise &lt;3 :)** 

Hi everyone!!! I want to share some optimism and positivity here. We most of the time share the bad and negative side effects of meds so I wanted to share a little with you the good that has happened recently. **BEAR WITH ME** ! It's going to be a long post, but it's worth it I swear. &lt;3 

I'm a 29 woman living in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. I'm French Canadian, so sorry for my imperfect English :) 

For as long as I can remember, I've always felt depressed, anxious, uncomfortable in my head and body, bored, lonely... I remember at 10 years old looking at the sky and thinking ''I don't think I'm made for this world, I will kill myself one day''. That's absolutely not normal for a ten years old. 

During my teenage years and early twenties, things were always awful. I was extremely emotional, extremely anxious, could never focus on something for too long. I was extremely dependent on my SO and friends, men, an extreme people pleaser. I self medicated with alcohol and cocaine. I slept 3-4hrs a day. Slept with every men I could put my hands on and put my life in danger multiple times. I had an eating disorder and lost 25lb in a few months and sometimes only ate a yoghurt a day. I was getting vertigo and fainting. I self harmed a lot. I was a tsunami, a tornado, I could never predict how I would be feeling the next hour. 

I almost failed a year in high school, almost dropped out, got expelled in college from my program... It took me 7 years to get my bachelor degree. Phew. 

In my entire life, i was fired from *5 jobs* in total. 

Everything was always so hard. Everything was always a struggle. And it just kept getting worse and worse. Then in 2016 I hit the lowest point, my first real constant major depression. So in the summer 2017, I remember telling myself ''I give myself three years to try and get better, and if it STILL doesn't work, I will kill myself''. 

Fortunately, a diagnosis quickly followed for me, the same as my mother, bipolar 2. I identified a little with it, but not that much, but I had no other chose. My path to wellness could finally start, I had a direction. 

**SO SORRY FOR THE LONG POST, I'M TRYING TO MAKE IT AS SHORT AS I CAN !**

I stopped drinking, doing drugs... Started therapy, started eating again, and started medication. But it still was awful for the next four years, until recently. 

**MEDICATION I TRIED:** 

For the last four years, I was put on different bipolar meds. Lamictal (lamotrogene), Risepiradal, abilidy, seroquel, latuda... None really worked. I was still a wreck. But I thought that was how life was supposed to be, so I shut up and went on, but almost everyday I told myself ''one day I will end it all, because it's TOO hard''. Lamictal gave me irritable bowel syndrome, and to this day I still have it. I'm sick everyday. Risperidal didn't work, abilify gave me akathisia, seroquel made me even more depressed and latuda gave me daily panic attacks for months. I was also diagnosed with adhd, a diagnosis I had to FIGHT to get, and tried biphentin and concerta, withtout much success. 

**PSYCHIATRIST EXPERIENCE:**

What made it also difficult wasn't only the medication, but the psychiatrist I was seeing. It took me three years to realize it wasn't a good fit at all. She was always hesitant to prescribe me something, and wasn't really listening to me. We had only 10 minutes appointment. When I raised concerns, or side effects from the meds, she would brush them off. I now realize that with a different psychiatrist, my suffering would have lessen years ago. Before the latuda, I was off meds for a year and a half because of my irritable bowel syndrome. I called her one day, crying, because I wanted to kill myself. I told her I needed to be put on something. Her answer? ''But you are doing so well! You graduated with good grades and you have a good job, you don't need medication!''. Same for the ADHD meds. She only wanted me to take it when I had administrative work to do, when I was very clear that it was impacting every aspect of my life very negatively. What happened? I got fired from my job because I was constantly making mistakes. She once told me that she considered someone to be mental ill only when they weren't functional at all. I think that's extremely problematic. We need help BEFORE it becomes that bad. Last year, I shared with her my concern that I didn't identify with my bipolar diagnosis, because I hadn't been manic in years and was just depressed and anxious. And that I needed help with my depression mostly. She brushed it off. 

**WHAT HAPPENED THIS YEAR:** 

In june, I abruptly stopped my latuda, my mood stabilizer, the only medication I was on. It was causing me constant panic attacks and severe anhedonia, and I couldn't handle it anymore. I tried to call my psychiatrist but she didn't call me back until a few days so I just stopped it. It made me spiralled down in just a few days and I had to go to the emergency psychiatric hospital because I wanted to kill myself. 

That was on June 27th. For the next three months, I was put on seroquel, and then abilify. Both were horrible. For three months straight, everyday, I wanted to kill myself. I would wake up in the morning and think ''anyways, it's okay if I'm suffering right now, I don't have too long to live on this planet anyways, it's gonna end soon''. I was desesperate, because I had been so good for the past four years. I had done everything. Expensive therapy, no alcohol, exercise all the time etc etc. And there I was. Still struggling. Harder than every. At the verge of suicide. Chemically speaking, my brain was a mess. I can honestly say that from may 2021, since the latuda started acting out, till end of october, I suffered every second of it. No moment of relief. Just pain. I couldn't do anything, I just layed in my bed, starring at the wall. Empty. Suffering. Barely ate. 

**But I used the last of my hope and energy to change psychiatrist.** 

**And that changed everything.** We talked for two hours on our first appointment. He immediately gave me an appointment for the next week, because he needed time to think about the right thing to do. 

He changed my diagnosis. I don't have bipolar disorder, I have major chronic depression with mixed features. Which is different, and treated differently.

Then he put me on an antidepressant, Luvox, and SSRI. I saw how depressed I was and saw right away that this had to be treated. 

A few weeks after, on a mood stabilizer to even out. 

Since a few days, on vyvanse for my adhd. 

The three first weeks on the SSRI were HELL I wanted to kill myself. But my psychiatrist listened to me, put on benzodiazepine for a few days so that I can ride the intense waves. I was crying in his office because I was shocked by his kindness, and because he believed me and I could see he didn't want me to suffer. 

***So what I want to say with all this:***

I always thought I would end up killing myself. I just knew it. I never thought I would grow old. Now, I'm slowly thinking it can happen. I'm still not great, but I am so much better. Not everyday is a suffering. I'm still not ready to go back to work, but I hope I will be soon. But now I know to trust my gut. We are still not set on my combo of meds, but I'm hopeful now. Because I found things that work. Because I have a psychiatrist who CARES and WANTES me to get better. He works WITH me, and wants the best for me. He takes time to thing about options for me. 

**WHAT I WANT TO SAY TO YOU:** 

**Trust your gut. You are not a difficult case. Even if you are, you deserve to be treated and cared for by a professional. There are options of there, tons of them. It will be a long road, but there is a combo out there that will be okay for you. YOU DESERVE TO FEEL BETTER. You really, really, really, really do. And you can. I know it takes time, I'm so sorry and it makes me sad that you are suffering right now. I know all that. I'm not cured, I never will, I still suffer, but it's so much better and I have hope. I have it for you. I want you to have it too. You deserve people who believe in your recovery, in your health... You deserve it just because.** 

It can get better. I'm still shocked. But it does. 

Thank you for reading my story. Love you guys. Take good care of you, you beautiful person. &lt;3",1
"Most nights I pray I don't wake up in the morning. I have nobody to live for. Nobody to love. No purpose. I'm a pathetic piece of shit. A waste of space. A wast of money. A waste of time. I sometimes have dreams that I'm in love. That I met someone worth living for. But it's just a dream. It's not real, and I'll never have that. I give up.",1
why was i born in such bad timing fuuuuuuuuuuuuck,1
"Im hiding out in my freaking toilet at home. Just locking myself in. I dont want to face my mom or anyone. I have no where else to go. I cant leave yet, itll cost me lots of money to get my own place. Im so tired and stressed out. My family triggered me so much, my head is banging it hurts.",1
"I really just need to let all this shit out cause I feel like everything is getting worse constantly and as far as I'm concerned its not gonna get any better. recently there has been things come up in my life that has made already existing things even worse and I really cant cope with it anymore. 

I've been manipulated and lied to almost my whole life and my earliest memory is a depressing one. recently things have been getting worse and I have self harmed on multiple occasions and i honestly have thought about just ending it all. I thought that my depression started in Year 6 on Primary school (around 11 years old) but I don't know if it started earlier when I really look back at when my head was being filled with all these lies and manipulation. I am trying to get help at the moment and I have been diagnosed with severe depression, but even if I'm trying to get help and have been more open to family and friends I still cry myself to sleep, and I have been thinking more and more about suicide and I don't know if I'm going to make it to my 18th birthday or even the new year. I feel like something is wrong with me, I just feel like my brain works slower than others and it makes people angry when I don't get things or I misinterpret things and I have to apologise because of it, it makes me feel worthless and that I'm stupid and that I don't amount to as much as others. I've never had a family like my siblings did and while I at least have my mum and dad whereas others don't and I'm grateful that i have them it still doesn't fill the whole I had in my heart, I've still always been jealous of my siblings for being able to have an actual family that isn't filled with lies and manipulation. they've had my mum and dad in the same room without them hating each other. Also I just want to clarify that my mum hasn't done anything bad to me, its my dads side of the family, and while I know they all love me I don't think they fully grasp the damage they've done. sometimes I think that my parents splitting was my fault, I mean it was fine until I was born. sometimes I think that maybe things would be different if I wasn't born. anyways I don't really know if people will care to read this but I just needed to say something. there's more that I want to say but ill just keep this one shortish and if there are any spelling or grammar issues I apologise, It might just be a dumpster fire and it might be full of me just complaining, I'm not sure. well if you got this far then thank you for caring enough to read",1
M/26 here Lately especially this week my depression is hitting hard it's getting tough to tell what my emotions are I feel completely numb and oblivious to the things around Mei want to cry but my brain and body just don't know how to let it out it feels like I'm doing the same thing over and over every day. I don't wanna kill myself but I wanna die I sometimes thing about putting myself in situations that could kill me but I try to zone out when those thoughts happen I zone out alot Lately I feel like I can't talk to anyone in my family I feel so alone I sometimes think about telling a stranger and just asking for a hug my it's not socially excepted to do that and I don't want to be a weirdo I just feel lost and I just want something someone to hold my hand and tell me how to fix myself it feels like I'm trapped in someone else's body like I took there seat I'm not supposed to be here someone else is .,1

"I need to get away from my abusive mom.
Hi I’m a 15 year old girl from pa, my mom has been abusing / mentally/emotionally/ and sometimes physically. It started out with name calls,telling me she hates me. It continued with her trying to fight me: beat me up she would lock the kitchen so I couldn’t eat, and leave for weeks on weeks on expensive trips while I stayed home starving to feed my little brother. She lied to the police when she kicked me out and had me 302. I was diagnosed with severe depression, adhd and ptsd. I can no longer attend school or get a job atm. I mom working on getting my GED now so I can work and find a good place for me and my therapy dog to live.I haven’t been home for 6months. She called off my ent card, and now I have 4 food stamps and 1 dollar to my name. She had my 20 year old brother find me a month ago and beat me up. Cys can’t help that much because I haven’t been home to receive the abuse anymore. She still continues to do things to hurt me even tho I “exscaped”, I still feel trapped. I’m planning on getting emancipated when I turn 16 in January. Anything will help, I just need somewhere to stay while I work for my ged. (Where I’m at rn she doesn’t approve and is fighting for me to get taken to the system.) what do I do. Please help, and also how can I find a under the table job still being underage/ no guardian",1
So I've been taking 150mg of zoloft every day for 2 years. I had to taper off my meds since I expected to miss my psych appointments due to having left the country (I brought all my meds with me but I knew they would run out so I slowly tapered down. I cant continue seeing a psychiatrist since government treatment is limited for non citizens and i cannot afford seeing a private psych). I\\ve been tapering off to taking only 50mg a day now after months of tapering down but ive completly run out and the withdrawal is absolutely kicking my ass rn (brain zaps are the fucking worst). Anyone just stopped taking meds before with any advice on how to get through this? I looked it up and apparently discontinuation symptoms could last anywhere from a week to a month. I just dont think I physically have it in me to get through this shit rn. I feel like jumping off a bridge and pulling all the hair out of my scalp rn. Help?,1

I hate being like this. I hate having to explain my condition constantly and nobody can understand. 

I’m not going to kill myself even though anytime my mind is clear like when I’m going to bed, my first thought is I should buy a shotgun. Every night.

"This is going to be a long one. I've struggled badly with my mental health since I was about 11 or 12 years old. To start, when I was born, it was just me, my mother, papa, gran and auntie. My father left before I was born and wasn't there for the first few years of my life. Everything was good for me as a child, but then my auntie died at age 24 with cervical cancer. I was too young to know any better. At 11 or 12 my papa died of complications, and he was my idol, like a father to me, that destroyed me, and sent my mother deeper into her depression as he was her anchor too. She committed suicide when I was 14 or 15 which completely ended any hopes of a normal life for me. I have a sister too, she's 6 years younger than me, and with my father in out lives again, he hated me and I hated him. She was his princess and I was always the bad one, always getting slapped about by him because she was a trouble making snake. I've never gotten on with her. My Gran was one of the only ones left that I had in my life, and because she went through hell too, it made her very bitter, which rubbed off on me. She lost her first born son shortly after her was born, her next daughter was an evil snake too that stole 10s of thousands from her, and we didn't find that out until my gran passed away about 6 or 7 years ago. Her other 2 daughters were my mum, and my auntie who is still with us thankfully, but she is riddled with MS and has been slowly deteriorating over the years. I can't blame her for being bitter after all that. I was always with her, helping with shopping and everything. Aside from my family, I've had nothing but trouble with friends and partners too. With the exception of my best friend, who I've been friends with since we were 2 years old. Every single other one has dropped me like I meant nothing to them. I did everything for my friends, even helped one I considered my second closest friend maintain his flat, worked my arse off while he partied and stole from me. Lazy c*nt wouldn't even get up to go to college while I was working 12-14 hours a day in retail. He dropped me like I meant nothing once he got what he wanted. 14 years I wasted on him. With regards to my love life and partners, I've never had a good experience. I first fell in love with a girl at my first ever job. 6 months I chased her, and at the end she finally came to me. 10 days of whirlwind romance, and then she texts me randomly one day and says if I ever contacted her again, she'd call the police. This crushed me and I tried to kill myself, 250 pills swallowed. My best friend saved my life that day. Weeks I spent in the hospital recovering, only to get out and have a visit from the police warning me to stay away from her. The next time I fell in love was with a girl I spent 5 years with. I moved in with her and her mother. The worst possible idea. Her mother took full advantage, charging me a third of all the money I earned for rent. She had me doing all the chores in the house despite working 12 hour days again. Between paying her and my girlfriend, her mother would go on holiday every few months while I was stuck in that tiny room with nothing but weed to keep my placid while my girl also went out with her friends who hated me. She would constantly talk about her exs and made me feel like shit. She tossed me aside a few days before Christmas 2 years ago like I meant nothing, saying I didn't care about her and that I was cold. I wonder why? Could it be the way you've treated me over those 5 years? I moved back in with my dad and we've gotten on a lot better since thankfully, he's still incredibly difficult. I can't talk about anything to him without him telling me I'm stupid for letting things get to me. I had to spend that Christmas alone in a tiny toom with a burst blow up mattress, while my family went out to eat. Father, sister and his mum, dad and sister, who I don't really take much to do with. I started working in a supermarket just down the road, which has been hell to deal with, the people I work with are extremely cliquey and talk down to me all the time. The customers are even worse, they treat you like shit and know you can't do anything about it. This is when I fell for someone again, nearly 2 years I stopped myself asking her out. She started to warm up to me, and I couldn't hold it in. I was rejected, which hurt, but I accepted it, I don't hold a grudge. I've been trying to distance myself from her to get over it. That's when I stupidly messaged a girl who kept looking at me when she was in and smiling as a means to get over the other girl I really liked. She is beautiful and I wanted to get to know her. She blocked me and put in a complaint to my work. Now I've been forced off the checkouts and into the nightshift. I've to be investigated and have no idea what will happen. The shop is run by an evil woman, she makes everyone's life hell in that place. She's been complained about many times, and yet is still there. This is clearly her doing, because my manager at the checkouts is too nice and supportive to do this to me. I'm terrible at the shop floor, too slow and nowhere near fit enough to get it done. That's why I went to the checkouts in the first place, I excell at customer service, get good comments all the time and have never had an altercation with any of them. I'm at the end of my tether. I'm honestly either want to walk out of the job, or, heaven forbid, end it all here. I swore I would never let myself get that low again, but bottling up everything that has happened to me through the years has taken a toll on me. I tried the doctors for help and he said I should help myself, no medication, no councilling, nothing but some leaflets on self help. I'm stuck guys, and I don't know what to do. Please help me.",1
"My mother and I have an extremely difficult and sad relationship, we didn’t get along since maybe third grade. She kept information away from me about my visits to see a psychologist in elementary school which would’ve been crucial to getting a diagnosis earlier (I’m on the spectrum). She’s been manipulating me since I was a little child, never spending time with me, sending me down to the lady who lived underneath our flat to do homework because she “didn’t have the nerve” to do homework with her 9 year old daughter. I could go on for hours. My mother knows I’ve been in a depressive episode for an entire year now— yet she fails to recognize my emotions. I’ve always had a hard time expressing my emotions, I cannot handle them. I rarely talk to my mother but every time she does something that upsets me and makes me cry for the entirety of the night she just goes “What are you so mad for? Why are you mad? Why are you so angry?” When I’m crying to her face obviously hurt by her actions. I think she does that because she doesn’t want to show me empathy and if I’m angry there’s no need for empathy in the first place. I’m writing this because my mother never takes me shopping, she knows I need a new pair of jeans and yet she cancelled on me last minute because she is going shopping with her friends. I don’t have friends to shop with. When I’m alone in public I get so anxious I want to curl up and cry. She doesn’t even see she did something wrong.

The most damaging thing that porn did to me was that it made me have zero energy. I know what I need to do to get my shit together but I have absolutely no energy to do so, Am I a victim of the porn industry ? or am I playing the victim to shift the blame from me ? deep down I know that a big part of the blame lies on me but it's so fucking hard and I can't ask for help because I won't stand the look of dissapointment on my close people's faces.

"I have depression since some years ago. In addition, i was also diagnosed with dissociation and social anxiety. Now, i am a freshman at high school, and i was actually doing kinda better, since i met new people and my mother finally divorced from my stepdad. However, everything's going downhill again: I feel angst all the time. Literally, all the time. I might laugh, i might watch my favourite movie or eat my favourite ice cream. It doesn't matter: That feeling is always there. I look around, i can't feel that i belong to the place that i am. I look in the mirror and all i see is the worst version of myself.

But still, i keep on trying.

Everyday i repeat good things to myself. I try to change my mindset, i try to set goals. I talk to my grandmother, the one and only person that is able to make me feel better somehow. It works? Sometimes. Sometimes i kinda see the same sun i used to see some years ago. Just it's first ray. But it's not required much time for me to make that yellow turn blue again. 

It's kinda like if it happened automatically? As if my body denied any kind of happiness i DESERVE to feel. Because i know it, i know that i deserve to be happy and feel happy as any other person.

So why am i like this? Why is it all like that? 

Other thing that is killing me softly is those guys at school: They're making fun of me. Actually, i am not 100% sure, but look: Me, innocently, noticed that one boy. I thought his eyes were pretty, and they really are, so i looked at him one time, and probably another one cause i'm curious. Coincidently, after that we started to pass by each other many times? I mean, we're in the same school, so it should be normal. The thing is, that i noticed him and his friends laughing or smirking when i pass by, but it's not giving me a good vibe, yk? Even when his friends ain't with him, i see and i feel them staring at me. Now? I'm terrified. I have suffered from bullying before a dozen times, and now in high school again? Because of literally nothing? I feel so nervous when they are around, that i needed to go to the infirmary because my heart was beating excessively fast, and i was afraid of just collapsing in there. Yeah, i might be just over thinking, but that's the problem: I am an overthinker. I have social anxiety. I was being able to ""control"" it and focus on other things when i was in public, but now i just want to hide inside a box for the rest of my life. Not only because of those guys tho, that was only and example of a thing that triggered me.

There's also the fact that i live in a foreign country, which language is really hard for me. However, my dream has always been to study and become a doctor. But with everyone telling me i can't, what do i do? how can i rise up?

I loved to dance, but the teacher used to fatshame me (which is ridiculous because i am literally 60 kg and 168 cm, so i am not overweight at all).

My mom is always putting the fault of her failures, her failed marriage and everything on me.

And i just want to give up. I just want to end it all. But guess what? I am a Christian, and i still have a family. I would never be able to let them down.

yeah, ""them down"".

What about me? What can i do? How can i stop this angst, those fears, this anxiety? Since those things started happening with the boys and i had a certain fight with my ex-stepdad, my psychotic symptoms appeared again, and it makes me scared. I left the psychiatrist in the begging of september by choice, because i was really feeling that i could recover by myself from then on.

Guess i was wrong.

I just need a answer. Some tips, maybe? But most important of all, i needed to relieve this pain, and i am really glad that i found this subreddit to write about it.",1

I actually want to hold onto this meaningless life, for nothing...it's not even funny lol",1
"I feel like I’ve hit a brick wall. I’m 22 and I’ve suffered with depression for the past 6 years. Winters tend to be the worst for me it gets really bad around this time of year. I’ve wanted to stop existing for 6 years straight with a few breaks in between but I always seem to return to this same life is not worth it routine. I’m currently in Uni (college for the Americans) I came late after messing up an apprenticeship and repeatedly quitting for various reasons and I’m living away from home. 

I smoke weed &amp; play loads of PlayStation it seems to be the ONLY thing that I enjoy and even enjoyment is slowly disappearing from that. 

My biggest problem tends to be self sabotage it’s like because I know I won’t kill myself at this current time I try to make things worse so that maybe I’ll force myself to do it.

Uni is making it very easy to continue this behaviour, I don’t really leave my room I order food shopping online I never go to my lessons and whenever I go home to my Mums it just makes me not wanna come back to uni. 

I can’t seem to do ANYTHING I’ve got exams in just over a week that I’ve not done any work for and I just don’t care… I know in my current position I will fail and this debt &amp; time spent will be for nothing but I don’t care I just don’t want to be alive so I wake up late, lay in bed for hours then end up just smoking weed &amp; playing PlayStation again.

Im so fed up of the ‘how are you?’ Question cos truthfully no one gives a fuck deep down and that rare few that do just don’t understand or worse off they are in the same boat. Some people like relating to other’s problems but for me it reinforces the fact that it may never improve. 

Im lazy as shit with or without smoking I just don’t want to work or have the urge to achieve anything, I’m so close to just ordering a rope but I know I don’t have the balls to go through with it yet just in case it failed. So I guess I’ll continue to self sabotage until it’s bad enough for me to do it. Or until I end up a homeless bum cos my mum is fed up and if I drop out of uni I won’t be allowed home unless I’m working full time. 

So yeah I’m at this brick wall and I don’t know what to do. This is super long I guess no one will reply or read the whole thing but I had to get it off my chest somewhere",1
"Hello. Im not usually one to post my feelings publicly as I always feel stupid af for doing so. Like many on here I've suffered from depression for as long as I can remember (about 16 years). I have attempted to end my life numerous times, have had way to many mental breakdowns to count, and been on so many different medications it's hard to keep up.

I had major counselling about 7 years back which without I can guarantee I wouldn't be here let along writing this sentence.

About a year ago I hit my final breaking point. I was done. I had 2 choices, seek help, or finally end it all. Truthfully, I was about 99% leaning towards being done!! My plan was set and I was ready. I kept thinking that no one would take me seriously, nobody gives a fuck. They're all laughing at me anyway. But that last 1%, was my last fight. And I thought what does it matter. If I call and they don't give a shit I'm ending in all anyway so fuck it.
I called my doctors..... and they were amazing.

They put me straight through to a doctor who asked me to come straight in. He was amazing. Listened, didn't rush me, discussed my options. That phone call much like my counselling saved my life.


As for today. I've been on the same meds for a year. My mental health as improved dramatically. I still have my bad days/moments but the positives are finally outweighing the negatives. Being able to appreciate and enjoy the simple things like the stars in the sky or the leaves on the floor feels nice. Taking walks and looking at the trees, and nature helped massively. I also joined the gym which is a huge accomplishment (for me anyway) and an even bigger mental distraction.

The reason for this post isn't for me. I know it's going to get buried in this sub somewhere but I'm fine with that. If my short boring life story helps one person decide to seek help, I'm cool with that. Being what I e been through, and I've seen a LOT, and coming out fighting means I know whoever is reading this can to.

Don't ever be ashamed of who you are, or what you are going through!!!!! People do care!!!! And you are needed in this world!!!

When I'm mentally capable I'm hoping to turn my experience into something I can use with others in need of help. As Robin Williams once said 
""“I think the saddest people always try their hardest to make people happy because they know what it’s like to feel absolutely worthless and they don’t want anyone else to feel like that.”

You may be sad now. But the future doesn't have to be that way for you. Head up, be strong, always keep fighting ;",1
"How do I stop these feelings when it's just a result of the truth?
If I died right now, I'm not saying no one will be sad, but no one will really miss my presence.
I dont have kids or a partner. I care for my elderly mother but she just needs me here to cook and clean. Both siblings have their own lives and rarely check in. I don't blame them, their families are important.. I thought I was close with my friends but feel like I'm always checking on them and asking how things are with them and offering my time to help. But almost no one wants to know how I am. Every now and then they'll ask but the conversation almost immediately goes back to them. I have one friend who does ask most days we talk and even remembers when I say important things have happened and asks me how those things are going. But she is going through some really tough times and I can't expect her to pay any attention to me being all needy. Besides, she has a family and people who rely on her already. So anyway, I've come to this conclusion that if no one cares how I am in life, they won't miss me when I'm gone.
Thanks for listening (reading). I think I just needed to put this somewhere as it just keeps going around and around in my head.",1
"I want to remember the good things like funny memories with my friends, and when they bring up an inside joke I dont remember I feel shitty cause i can tell it bums them out. I can never recollect anything from my favorite movies and people think im being pretentious when I say I love a certain movie. They will quote something from it and I wont have clue what theyre talking about unless its a super popular quote :/ I honestly just dont have any good core memories with anything really. I dont know. I hate it I just want to get better and i feel like remembering the good things in life would help if only my brain would allow it. Is there anything i can do to help me with this?

TLDR: Is there a way to have better memory while struggling with depression?",1
Used to do it before but then always ended up in the hospital. Don't wanna die just want some tension relief.,1
"I wasn't really feeling myself lately. I felt so empty, and a part of me was losing its sanity. I thought distracting myself is the best way to escape from this feeling, but here I am, losing myself even more every day. I am not alone, right? I am not alone feeling this way. But I wonder what people do when their hearts are feeling empty. I wonder what they do to feel alive.

This emptiness consumes every piece of me. I hope I could also tell everyone that I'm okay without having a pang of sadness in my chest. I am just really tired of telling people that I'm fine, when the truth is, I'm losing my mind slowly.

No one knows that all this time, I am not okay. But I silently hope that somehow, someone will see it— the tiredness in my eyes and the sadness behind my smiles.",1
"i have made so many irreversible mistakes in such an unbelievably short amount of time. when i was 16 i got caught trying to pills in school. I was thrown out of the extracurriculars i was in at that point. 1 year later i decided to try xanax the first time and totaled my car that my mother bought for me. no one knew at the time that i was under the influence so i got extremely lucky. And then 2 months later the same thing happened, i got high on xanax and got my car stuck in a ditch. i had to have my family help me pull it out and they could tell i was fucked up. I’m now looked down upon by my outside family as a druggie, even though i only did it twice. I’ve tried to get a job but i have some sort of social anxiety where i feel completely incompetent and unable to do my job. i worked at pizza hut for 3 days and then got fired because i shotgunned a beer with some frat boys and someone i worked with found out. almost a week after that i got arrested for an aggravated DUI. My ex girlfriend broke up with me after that, which fucked me up so bad. At this point there is nothing i can do but wait for the court date. whenever i speak to my mother i can see the hurt and disappointment in her eyes. I can see that i wasn’t supposed to turn out like this. My father isn’t in my life because i suppose he would rather smoke meth than spend time with his kids, and my stepdad couldn’t care less about me. it hurts so much to see all my friends going to college and having the time of their lives while i’m just ruining my life and doin nothing but hurt my own family. During high school i hated myself and didn’t see the point in anything so i didn’t do any of my work, i somehow graduated with a 1.5. i just don’t know what to do. I don’t have anyone to help me. i just cry myself to sleep every night",1
"Warning: There is absolutely no coherent way to write what I feel. I had a quick burst of sadness and while on Reddit I decided to look up depression to see if I could get some help.
I’ve been diagnosed with major depression (honestly no clue what that means but that’s what my psychiatrist told me) and take meds for it. I have so many friends that are here for me and genuinely care about my well-being and I know it to be true. I also have a loving family currently, so what more could I ask for? God fucking knows. I struggle so much everyday for some reason, my brain can’t let me be happy. I’m constantly (unintentionally)thinking about bad times or bad things which ends up putting me in a bad mood. I can go from having an amazing time with friends to just an instant shitty, overwhelming time. I have struggled with my father passing when I was young (4yrs old) and my mother meeting and marrying other people. There is no proper way to handle that in my opinion. I don’t know what I’m saying and I don’t know how I expect help…but. Maybe someone can relate. In my head a lot of times it’s like a second voice saying “fuck I hate myself I need to kill myself” over and over. Versions of that run through my mind all the time, but my conscious mind will literally make me hit myself in the head (not aggressively) and say stop youre fucking better than that, because I know I am. But I subconsciously hate myself so much that I want to die. I don’t know how to make it stop. If you’ve read this entire incoherent mess of a post then thank you, I will very much appreciate any help you can give. Writing this I think to myself “fuck I hate myself I should kill myself” like ridiculous stuff that came to me after I thought I finished what I wrote. I’ve never ever attempted a suicide even though a lot of times I want to die, mostly because I can’t do that to my friends or family, they would be heartbroken. That’s what has kept me here. At one point last year the voices kinda overpowered me because I was drinking, and I got so angry out of no where that I grabbed a knife and fully stabbed my head multiple times. As the bleeding went on I looked in the mirror and knew that it wasn’t what I wanted. I called my good friend who was also my roomate at the time, crying my eyes out and I told him I hurt myself and needed help. He ran up stairs, took care of the bleeding, hugged me and talked to me for about an hour before he let me go to sleep after he made sure I was okay. That’s when I first got professional help. It was somehow necessary for that to happen. Again, thank you to anyone who reads this, I went off on a tangent, but I hope it at least reaches somebody. Love and peace to you,
Awood",1
"8th year since i found out im depressed. It's been going downhill ever since.

It just seems to me that it can not be fixed as it comes and goes in waves.

I'm stuck, been for a long time.
I've had therapy, about 8 years ago, i didn't do shit for it, cause i thought the psych would make it better for me. I know better now, and I've quit a lot of destructive behaviors on my own already, for the most part at least.
Now 8 years later, I'm still down in the well. I want to contact my general practitioner to get help for my depressed state. I just have no fucking clue how to approach this. I'm too insecure, and I overthink this way too much and all other things, helping me further down the shitter.
I know that they are there to help, but I just feel like I'm a bother. I don't wanna be labeled as crazy or unstable because of my state.
Any help would be greatly appreciated, I'm really at a loss.",1
"I have no feelings , I'm dead . Medication is making me emotionless, I'm a fucking monster not a human being anymore. You guys are lucky, I'm a fucking sick human full of pills in my system cause of bipolar disorder and psychosis. I'm so suicidal",1

When I take too long to get ready in the morning they complain about me being a lazy ass. I am so done with life. I have no real accomplishments so far. I stayed indoors for the majority of my life because I'm weak and too stupid to connect with others. Too lazy to understand what's going on around me. Its funny, I happen to be a co-president of a club, but wanna know why, its because my sister(the real president) created the club and gave me the position out of pity because she knows otherwise I won't get far in the college admissions process. I'm so unmotivated to work on my college apps so my dad is doing most of the grunt work, as a result he despises me. Who could blame him, having a weak and unintelligent son. FUCK ME!

I have depression, anxiety and panic disorder, but this feeling is just overwhelming despair and I don’t know exactly why.. I miss my ex. But I don’t know if I want to be with him forever. I like my current, but don’t know if it’s just a rebound. I’m having work difficulties and a lot of other issues so life is hard for me now… but I usually feel okay until the evening and then boom, despair. 

does anyone else experience this feeling?? 
Do you know why it happens? What should I tell my doctor?

"I think today is the day, I can't really kill myself as the burden placed upon my parents would be huge.

It's been years and i haven't been able to tell anyone about it even though i desperately need help, i just feel stuck whenever i try to tell someone about it. The tought of suicide is with me 24/7, i can't concentrate anymore, all day i feel like it's all dark around me and that i could snap at any moment. Trying to be positive around my friends and trying to hide all that is becoming a titanic effort for me. I'm pretty sure i also fell into alcoholism since i basically get shitfaced everyday, not even to have fun, i get drunk when i'm alone to feel less bad and it always ends with me going to bed completely drunk and feeling worse the day after. Lately it has gotten even worse since i completely fell in love with my best friend that i've known for years. Obviously i wasn't able to tell her anything and she doesn't know anything about all of that, i feel like she'd feel disgusted or disappointed by me if i did, she's actually the only thing holding me back right now, otherwise i'd already be dead. I feel like my head is such a mess, probably like this post too.",1
"30, 5'57"" here. So how do you cope being unable to forge a lasting relationship and having in mind that so many women find your height a disability?
There's nothing I can do to improve my condition. And, if I do, they won't notice either.
Yes, I know, Tinder is shallow. But at this point, being unable to commit into a long-lasting relationship, is the only way to get an ego fix and some lustful fun.
Yes, move on and get some other interests — I do. But in the end, it feels like wanting to play guitar and missing an arm. It's cruel to see some other friends having it much easier, with far more attractive women (they don't really care about).
I've done and overdone things I enjoy and in the end they fall flat. I get my fix when in good company of a nice chat and a good-looking woman. And it's like a daydream, always. When I've noticed, they're gone.
If I'm lucky, and sometimes I am, I get a date and end up making out or even having sex. But I'm just a quick fix, never the better option.
And I'm not asking for ultra gorgeous super models. Even the average ones are unattainable.
Sounds a stupid issue, but I've even thought of, well, leaving the scene for good, just out of frustration.",1
"I'm on week 4 of my 7th retry at antidepressants and they're still not working for me (I took buspar, bupriopon, effexor, Prozac, Lexapro, Adderall, now Paxil). 

I sleep 16+hours a day, shower and brush my teeth maybe twice a week. 

Haven't been to class in weeks and can't fall into probation again or I'll be kicked out. 

When I am awake I just stare at the wall or read Reddit for hours or feel bad about myself. 

I literally had no drive or motivation and have lost ~7 lbs in a month. 

Tried therapy 3x but they all were really bad therapists (thanks Kaiser), and I can’t afford private therapy 

Had to run away from abusive family as a minor and I have friends but I can’t even get out of bed let alone spend time with them

"Hi I’m a 15 year old girl from pa, my mom has been abusing / mentally/emotionally/ and sometimes physically. It started out with name calls,telling me she hates me. It continued with her trying to fight me: beat me up she would lock the kitchen so I couldn’t eat, and leave for weeks on weeks on expensive trips while I stayed home starving to feed my little brother. She lied to the police when she kicked me out and had me 302. I was diagnosed with severe depression, adhd and ptsd. I can no longer attend school or get a job atm. I mom working on getting my GED now so I can work and find a good place for me and my therapy dog to live.I haven’t been home for 6months. She called off my ent card, and now I have 4 food stamps and 1 dollar to my name. She had my 20 year old brother find me a month ago and beat me up. Cys can’t help that much because I haven’t been home to receive the abuse anymore. She still continues to do things to hurt me even tho I “exscaped”, I still feel trapped. I’m planning on getting emancipated when I turn 16 in January. Anything will help, I just need somewhere to stay while I work for my ged.

"I am going to see the psychiatrist on Monday. The last few months, and certain periods of my life, I've wondered ""do I have depression?"" Then I'll reason myself into thinking I dont. I think I have just come to terms with the fact that I have either mild or high-functioning depression at least. I took the DASS test online and it said I have moderate depression and mild stress.
My symptoms:
1) I seem to not feel joy when something good happens. Back in December last year, I bought a Nintendo Switch to keep myself occupied. Till now I've only played it 5 times and have no interest in it.
In March I got news that I got a scholarship and I was just like ""hmm....meh."" 2) I've lost interest in lots of things I found fun and can't seem to be bother to make the initiative. I was totally into this book, yet I havent been bothered to read it since April. I enjoy hiking and watching anime/tv series and yet I have not had the initiative to do so. These hobbies feel like hard work to even start. I also like going to the gym. I am starting to lose interest in that. On the days I do go, I don't do a full workout.
3) I get tired easily. Sometimes I make plans with people and cancel simply because I feel like it'll be tiring for me. When I am out, part of me feels like I really just want to go home and lie down.
Even when I go out alone, I just want to go home and lie down because I get tired easily.
4) I'm also losing interest in school. I've been having trouble being motivated to do work.
5) I feel hungry but eating feels like a chore. Sometimes Id rather snack on things during the day and have a meal before I sleep
6) My sleeping pattern hasnt changed much but I does not feel restful.
I DO NOT have any self-harm or suicidal ideation.
I still seem to be able to carry on with things but even small things feel like hard work sometimes

For some context, I am international student in Japan and due to covid I am homesick as I havent been able to see my family in 31 months.
In July and August, I defended my Master's thesis and took the entrance exam for my PhD course (which I passed).
---
I mentioned to my Prof on Wednesday that I feel depressed (but I did not mention the symptoms) and he seemed supportive. Told me I can have a break, lots of foreign students in Japan and even some local Japanese students in our department has developed depression, especially during this difficult time.
Then today, unsurprisingly he had a different tone. I never told him about my symptoms, I only said I think I have depression and I want to get it checked. Yet tofay he told me he thinks I'm just burnt out and tired because I am not like the other students who are depressed (he said this because I seem to be functioning properly.)

Guess my question is, do I seem to have depression?",1
I wanted to see a doctor today and finnaly go into rehab... my addiction and depression left me laying in bed and not going... i just called my mum to force me to go on monday so i can get back on track... this shit is hard. i lost so much weight over the past 2 months... im always vomiting and cant eat or sleep... im severly in danger now... dont ever do drugs to kill a sorrow you should have dealt with,1
"I know the simple answer to this question (bc life is all we have) but it's been eating me alive lately. Why does any of this shit matter? Everyone around me just does their daily routine just to go to bed and do the same shit all over again.

And I get life is what you make of it but everything seems so fucking pointless man. No matter how hard I try to believe otherwise, my brain reverts back to this question. I don't think I'm crazy for asking it but other people seem so content with doing the same exact shit everyday until their dead.

"Every teenager that I know either wants to waste their life partying and getting drunk or wants to talk about politics and social issues constantly.

I'm not trying to make out like I'm some special snowflake because I'm not. I just don't understand it and I don't know what to do. Literally everyone my age I've talked to falls into either one or both of those categories, or we just have nothing in common. I don't want to talk about politics because it stresses me out and I want to do more productive things than drinking and partying and causing trouble and being the sterotypical teenager.

"Title. I have literally no qualities, despite having a privileged upbringing, never experiencing a single moment of real suffering. No friends, talents, etc. Im not exaggerating, it literally goes like this: If it's a positive attribute, then I lack it, and if it's a negative attribute, it's fairly likely I am full of it.

There is no escape from this unique hell, and I don't even have the courage to end it all and lift the burden from my parents. All I do is wallow in my worthlessness, never able to fix even one thing about myself. Everything is so cold and distant, colors are so pale and uninteresting. People rightly distance themselves from me, hate me, are disgusted by my existence. 

I've decided to stop eating as much as I can help it, even though I can't 100% stop myself, I hope that limiting my food intake to a snack or two a day will make me less of a burden. I might even stop being fat eventually, and being disgusting in one less way couldn't hurt. I really don't deserve food anyway. Beyond that, I have no ideas on how to fix myself.",1

Even though millions have depression I never feel that anyone has the same as mine. I just feel different. I cant put it into words. I'm not saying I'm special. I just truly feel cursed but beyond what words can say. I feel like I don't actually exist. As if im just living in the background and no one fucking notices me. Almost like a NPC. It feels awful man. Every night I sleep alone. I've given up with women or having a good outlook on the future. I simply haven't blown my brains out not to hurt others even though I'm close to no one. What a joke existence. Wont be shocked when I die I am told its a hell simulation but jokes on them I already knew.",1

"this is my first reddit post so sorry if its janky. i just wna get stuff off my chest.

been struggling w depression for years now (18yrs old now) and it keeps getting worse. i tried therapies / counselling with my current school and it hasn't worked. its become so hard to even live or get up or do anything. 

at this point i keep having delusions, hallucinations and everything feels unreal, and i feel like a vessel. There's a lot more to this but i dont feel comfortable fully explaining but I think you get it. I want to get help or try something different but im so scared that ill be placed into a hospital forcefully and i really dont want that but its affecting the way i work, my friendships, and my life altogether. need to apply for college soon and havent even began to think about it. its scary and dark to be honest. S/lf H/rm + suicidal thoughts is also a major problem.

i was thinking of calling the doctor and asking for a referral of some kind but like i said, very scared since im self aware that itd be considered a ""severe"" case with the psychotic symptoms and such. It's like i have no one to turn to. I'm truly not sure what to do and whether i should go through. I always back out and its genuinely scary to think of even getting help this far in. :/ I think medication is the next step but regarding my age I'm not sure if anything fruitful will come from it. I really just dont know what to do anymore or what direction i should go in with this. I just don't want to be hospitalised more than anything in the world. If i get the medication, then i'll be optimistic to try it out but hospitalisation just scares me so much. 

I dont know if I'll make it another year if I have to continue like this. I just hate this so so much.",1

"how do any of you have the ability to write a full vent on here without just stopping mid post and delete it because you just feel stupid and whiney, and just feel like you know no one really cares? how can you manage to being so open even if it’s anonymous? this isn’t a hateful complaint or anything. ive tried opening up countless times, i don’t want to worry my friends or family with my rapidly declining mental health. the sudden spike in depression after months of not living with it. the sudden urge to go learn some dangerous new thing like skating because you don’t care about what happens to your body, you have an excuse for the self harm, it’s a just skating accident. i’m trying to play everything collected and cool like i always have, i can’t bring myself to cry, to tell anyone i feel like i can’t eat today because i haven’t done anything productive, i don’t deserve food. we’re poor we can’t afford to feed me too, not when i haven’t done anything to deserve it. not when im the homeless person living with my friends family because i have no where else to go and they flew my states across the US just so i have a place. they do so much for me already, i can’t afford to pay them back. i can’t afford to pay any of my friends back. putting the stress on them that im so mentally drained and tired of dealing with this, i feel like i’ve burdened everyone. i hate living, the fact i was born, ive always been a failure and even now i can’t even bring myself to be honest with my own fucking friends?? so how?? how can any of you be honest and open about this type of shit. how can you force yourself to be vulnerable? im living with the greatest weight i can possibly carry and i can barely wake up in the morning for work. i’m cracking and when i break i’m afraid of what’ll happen next.",1
"Hi all!

Some years ago I was suffering from a mysterious fatigue. After a while it turned out to be a sleep disorder, and after some trial and error Olanzapine turned out to be the wonder drug that solved my sleep issues overnight. I've been taking it ever since, but recently have developed a treatment resistant depression. 

Other changes that I noticed was that I felt no buzz from coffee anymore (usually very sensitive to it), couldn't get drunk (could down a bottle of whiskey on my own and feel barely tipsy), and had no effects from a strong dose of LSD (which I took in order to maybe help see what's causing my depression).

Now that I've been reading some reviews online, I see from both anecdotal and scientific evidence that Olanzapine can cause depression. After all, it works by blocking Dopamine receptors (among others)! 

So I've decided to stop taking it. Right now I'd rather be sleep deprived than as depressed as I've been lately. So my question is - has anyone else here experienced that, and how long did it take you to recover after you stopped taking it?",1
"1am in the morning. it's been a month or two since i have seen anyone. i have stepped outside my house to take out the garbage. that's it.
the potential i have when i'm even 50% functional is amazing. sadly, the amount of time in my life where that exists is minimal.
47 and i feel 100. it's hard to wake up in the morning.
i'm tired and sad and don't want to exist.
time is slipping away.
i can't turn my brain around no matter what i do. i'm so tired of the tears. so tired of the struggle to do anything.",1
I woke up after 2½ hours of sleep. My eyes keep opening. I filled the void in my chest with vapor. I scrape my jar for residue. My cough tastes like blood. Artificial rain and a fan drown out the deafening screech in my ears. I punched something Monday. Its Friday and my hand is throbbing. I think about nothing. I think about falling from a high place head first. I think its too risky. Id rather buy a gun. They took my gun. They took my drugs. I wanted those. I needed those. Now look. Zero dollars and no will to work. I'll scrape a few bucks together and get some fentynal. I cant stand being alive. Im going back to bed. Hope I never get up.,1
"I’m 19/M (Technically non-binary but I really don’t care) 

Right now, I am living with my boyfriend’s mom (who is really kind to me) and have been for a little over a year- I’m living together with them until my boyfriend graduates college and we can look toward our own place 

The issue? I don’t have my shit together, I have no clue what I’m doing, and I’m so lost and alone that I feel extremely hopeless towards everything 

The relationship with my mom and sister (only family I had) is just dissolved. I lost contact with my sister 5 years ago when she decided she wanted to remove herself from my mom and I and start life anew- this deeply pained then-14-year-old-me and even to this day has left me with serious trauma 

And then there’s the case of my mom, we went through homelessness together in which we both faced severely traumatic experiences- I dropped out of highschool, worked two jobs, and helped us finally get into a home before she totally broke down mentally and it was no longer safe for me to live with her (physical violence, raging alcoholism, verbal abuse etc etc) and now I’m here

I stayed in touch with my mom a little bit, but after she called me apologizing for the shit she did to me throughout my childhood- I didn’t feel anything and told her that I felt like I should’ve just moved on. This was painful to do, but she brings so many painful memories and I’m trying to progress forward with my life in hopes of breaking free from my horrifying past. 

Now, I’m seeing all of my friends find new jobs, advance in life, and do better things, and yet I’m stuck here trying to pick up rocks in hope of finding some meaning to something

I feel so empty, and I want to seek help for my mental health but I’m so busy and overwhelmed with all of the shit I have going on now. The possibility of school seems nil at this point unless I can magically find the time, and my skill in various softwares and computers means fuck all because I don’t even have as much as a highschool diploma under my belt, I wasn’t even bad in school and that just tears me into pieces every day.

I feel like if things didn’t collapse and fall apart I’d be on track to where I wanted to go in life, but I’m continually losing all motivation and will to live as the grim reality of my existence here is setting in

I’m only driven to keep trying for my boyfriend, who has been so amazing and supportive to me- I want to give him the world and see him be so happy, because he truly has been one of the most honest and caring people in my life (that’s coming from someone who has chronic trust issues and generally dislikes people) 

But every day just brings me closer. I have had thoughts of cutting myself again (clean for two years now), I have suicide plans lined up, and a “distribution of possessions” in case I fall off the deep end and go through with committing suicide.

What the fuck do I do? How do I figure something out, I just want some guidance or something because it’s looking now like the lane is ending, and I’m merging into the cliff side",1
"I almost basically wiped out my savings because of this. I was so happy to have a decent savings and it’s almost gone because I can’t stop buying stuff as a reward for just… getting through the day. I’m having trouble coping as it is and now I just feel so stupid. I’m so lost, so defeated at everything and I’m going to suffer for another stupid decision. 

I’m tired of feeling so alone and like I don’t have anyone to talk to so I end up with bad coping habits just to keep myself going. I don’t know what to do anymore.",1
"It’s almost Christmas I try to always give my siblings and mom gifts for Christmas no matter what at the very least one. It’s one of the only things that makes me feel good I feel useful for once. Getting work has been hard lately but showing up when I am scheduled has gotten harder just having to put up a front with randos feels pointless. As bills continue piling up and car necessities keep popping up i see my money disappear just as it came. I feel devastated i might not be able to gift my family anything this year. As mentally I don’t feel I’ll be able to push through another year as my shit worthless life is going. I’d rather not I’m already a pain and disappointment. The least I could do is leave a good memory and enough to be creamated. I’ve never liked the idea of being buried to be eaten I rather be burned to ash. I always joke about my funeral but even I’m too broke for that and I’d prefer to not have my dead self displayed to people who could’ve cared less whether I had died or not. Keep me in a box or throw me away its all the same to me.I just hope I was useful wipe and sell anything I leave. Soon everyone will forget i barely exist in the filth of my own room i can barely be bothered to clean because it’s for me and I couldn’t careless about myself. I don’t need or deserve anything i have accomplished nothing but being the biggest family failure I ruined everything and do nothing but disappointment. So there really no reason i should be here, it’s just my selfishness wishing it would start to feel better but it just gets worse. I hope nobody misses me i hope my cats and dogs can forgive me. I just hope they find someone better who can offer a better life than i ever did.",1

"Hi everyone. I woke up yesterday and just felt really depressed for no reason. I don’t know why. I really don’t know what to do because whenever I even try to get myself to do anything, I can’t. I don’t know whether it’s lack of sleep (i sleep like 6.5 hours/day which I’d assume is healthy) or because I overwork myself and this is a sign to give myself a break. I really am not sure, but I would really appreciate any advice.",1
I just remembered this time from 2 years ago where I cried for an entire day after self harming. I physically could not stop crying. I honestly can’t believe it because that distressed feeling like I was being pushed to the very limit of my sanity never went away and I was fighting every day in the hopes that it would. It’s honestly embarrassing because all of my actions have been completely irrational and I just have years and years of breakdowns and embarrassing memories. I feel like this inescapable whirlwind is literally just my life now like my brain just adjusted and now I am stuck like this forever. I really miss emotional stability.,1
"I went to the doctor 2 days ago and they diagnosed me with depression (I think thats how you say it) Im a kid in high school and i have been suffering from it for a while now. The doctor and my mom told me that I should go to my counselor at school. Part of my depression is making me not wanna do anything i just feel super unmotivated and i get distracted at school a lot. So for that i have really shitty grades (all f’s) 

One of my friends told me that if i go to the counselor they might cut me some slack for my grades because of how im feeling and i was just wondering if thats true.

Thanks in advance",1
"Before I go any further, here's a bit of a background. I'm in my early 20s. Spent most of my life moving and never staying in one place. Childhood on one side of the country, bad things happened, abusive father and economical problem. I was bullied in elementary and middle school for being a little different I guess. Abusive father was taken away, pays child support. Left all that behind one day and went to the west coast in a cheaper state, started over. Grew up there, went thru the rest of middle school and dropped out of high school because of learning disabilities and receiving no help, my stress got so bad my mother pulled me out of school. I was getting nowhere with my education despite trying my hardest. And funny enough, after dropping out of high school, I was happier than ever and started learning so much more on my own. Had the time of my life just going out and doing things with friends. Making good memories. I was doing better but I was slowly losing control of my life, i was addicted to drugs, smoking tons of weed since I was 15, some opiates too. Despite all the fun I had, I knew I was fucked up. I did have some good friends. But now we only speak occasionally since i left. Things were okay from that point onward where I left high school but I was severely depressed and it progressively got so much worse as I started to spiral out of control. Wouldn't brush my teeth ever. Smoked tons of weed and cigarettes everyday with a bit of drinking on the side. Made lots of bad friends but I eventually made and kept some good ones like I said. It was alright for the last few years there. Ended up leaving with my mom and back to the east coast when I was 19, since we always planned to anyway. The long awaited day finally arrived. It was all temporary when we first got to New Mexico. Went to the sticks in upstate New York because that's where 2 of my siblings are. We don't have anything in common. Used to look up to them as a kid. I don't anymore. It's like I don't even know my older brothers. They grew up too. I'm the youngest, they're 7+ years ahead of me. A few years of isolation out here, doing the same shit everyday, hanging out with friends online, getting into shenanigans, meeting some good people on the internet too. It was 2 years in New York state, then me and mom moved in with our family in New Jersey to take care of grandma because she's was old and not well, she passed away in June this year, after we left. We left January first that year. Turns out the everyone else in the family went downhill and it's a toxic mess. We cut everyone off and ended up moving back to New York on January first after some really bad drama between me, my mom and her other siblings giving us a scapegoat treatment. Blamed for bad things happening. Accused of stealing money and my mom running away from everyone in new mexico. It was a very toxic place. We went right back and cut everyone off. They aren't family anymore. Fuck them. I have no friends up here. I'm on the autism spectrum and socializing can be very mentally taxing, relationships are difficult to maintain and I just don't understand the world. Navigating a social world on the autism spectrum is like walking around in a minefield.
I was always alright being alone, I'm a bit on the introverted side but for 4 years like this? It's horrible. That's the story for the most part. Now it's present day. On reddit making this post, and I'm fucking lost.
I Came back up here to New York this year, after what happened in New Jersey and it all went to complete shit. All the years caught up to me all at once. Worse than ever. It all hit me like a train.
At 21 I successfully quit smoking and drinking, but recently my lung collapsed. That truly did it for me. It really made me quit smoking completely. I'm still recovering. I brush my teeth now, but I have had multiple teeth extracted in the last few years and I need at least 2 root canals and more fillings, crowns too. I have no insurance. I've been sitting here for years with rotting teeth and my molars ripped out. Brushing and flossing still. Feel like I'm doing all I can to salvage what's left of me. I have acid reflux, it got worse over the years and turned into a whole other thing where I can't even digest food properly. I assume I have a damaged esophagus or something because I feel lots of food getting stuck in my throat. it causes a choking sensation without the feeling of actually choking. I need to throw up, but I cant. It's just stuck. It's the most uncomfortable thing ever. I don't even eat right anymore. I feel like my life is falling apart. For years I've been trying to hard to become a better person, ever since I got out here. I quit smoking cigarettes recently. I quit drinking. I quit smoking weed. It's been months without it. I'm done with it all but still, my lung collapsed. Still have teeth rotting because I never brushed as a teenager, all due to severe depression. Can't afford treatment just yet either. I had to leave all the decent friends I made and follow my mother. I had no choice. I'm so sorry guys. Earlier this year, I made one big choice for myself, to go back to the west coast, right where I was years ago, where my friends are. I know they're still there for me because we still talk sometimes. They know I'm coming back. Me and mom want to. It's best for us. I just want to move on.
Now I spend most of my days on the computer or on the xbox, having online friends and doing the same thing everyday for years. Not going outside for anything. Only for 30 minute walks and short grocery trips. Even my mother had the worst of it this year. She had a stroke back in march and I've been worried about her health ever since. It's affected her ever since. She can't work anymore so now I'm paying most of the rent with my disability. She's all I got left. Especially after me and her move out west, she'll be the only family I have anymore. Now my worst fear is losing my mom.
Yeah, It's been one hell of a ride. I'm tired of it. The worst part of it all is I'm facing it all alone, nearly complete isolation besides my mother being here and being there for me, that's all I got. I just want to go back home next year. Start a new life again for a third attempt and just stay there with what I had, at least I have some opportunity in the west coast. I'm ambitious, I just can't find the energy to follow that ambition like I used to. All my energy is gone, It's like I used it all trying to survive out here. I just want to be somewhat healthy again but I feel like the damage is already done. It all caught up to me in one single year and I'm trying so hard to get it together and be healthy and happy. It's all I want. I fucked up a bit of my life but I'm trying to fucking hard to just make it right for me. All of that with nobody to talk to in person besides my mother. I'm a shut-in who lives on disability and pay at least half the rent with it to make my moms life a bit easier because it's all I can really do. I don't know anymore. I want to die but I dont want to kill myself or give up. Just keep going. Fuck it. Whatever. Let's go. Sometimes all I want is to be heard and maybe understood. Someone out there to read this story of mine and to just say something to me. Encourage me to go on. Or just talk to me, something. Anything at all. I'm open to anything. Even friends. Let's all be friends. If you read all of this, just know that I really appreciates it. I'm at my lowest point and I spent the last hour and a half typing this whole thing out on a phone. I just want things to work out in the end. All of this is fucked up. I know I made some bad decisions in my life and got a bit messed up on drugs and neglected my health for so many years. And I'm actually trying my hardest to get better. I stopped smoking entirely and doing pills. No drinking. I'm brushing my teeth. Watching out for my health, despite all that's happened. It still feels like I've made no progress. Even if I know I have and I've come a long way. I hope I get somewhere with this soon. I miss having a life. I miss having friends and laughing, smiling. I never had a home. But now I know where it is now. its back on the west coast where I used to have these things. All my friends know I'm coming back next year. Let's just hope things turn out alright for me in the end. Again, thanks so much for reading all of this, if you did. It was a lot. Some support or encouragement in the comments would really help me out. I'm okay with people dming me because I could really use some friends too, if I'm being honest. I need it more than ever. Anything helps. I really need it.",1

"Hello,

I kinda hit a new low and need a place to vend. Sorry for that.

First of, I've been struggling with depression since I was 12 years old. Alone most of the time. Been to therapy a few years ago, tried medication and stuff. Depression always behind me to get me. My family never noticed and/or cared. Mental health just wasn't important I guess. Even being in a long term relationship never helped cause my husband never really cared. At first I thought I needed to open up more, so that people could understand me. Turns out that Wasn't it. Whenever Something really bad happened and I was starting to fall back into depression, I kinda had to figure it out myself how to survive while getting hate from my surroundings for not functioning like I should. It hurt. But I never knew it could be different. Right now I am silently suffering after my second miscarriage this year after wishing for a child for years. Even in this situation, I feel alone with the aftermath of this experience. Everyone else already passed the point of feeling sad about it. After 2 weeks I am expected to function again. Expected to be in the mood for Sex. And moving on emotionally.

All I can think of is: What the fuck?!

And at the same time, I realized I don't really matter. My feelings are not important for those around me. But they expect me to feel happy and function?

Furthermore, I am in dire need of therapy, which kinda isn't possible cause I would need to wait months for my first appointment? Fuck you and thanks for nothing I guess.

So what, guess I am on my on again. This just sucks.",1

"THIS IS A LOOONG POST
When I was 6th grade, it was last day of school I had group of friends to hangout with, anyway there is this friend we made fun of, he let go 2 of my friends, but then kicked me, I was shocked as why he kicked me and not my friends, anyway I did not kick him back (idk why? Is it because I was shocked? Afraid?... Idk) anyway after I finished my exam, I went to my mom crying about the situation, mom shouted at me for not defending myself, because I should have to, ok 6th grade finished,in 7th grade someone did not let me play football with the rest of class, so I decided to tell the principal about it, i did not like the idea of me being left out, it was not fair, anyway he got angry at me and pushed me, and I cried for not being that strong, anyway I cried to mom again, forgetting what happend to me in 6th grade, and I got kicked by mom for not defending myself, this is where my ocd started, next day I kicked him in his neck and told him this is for pushing me, well, then I cried, guess I was not that strong, anyway, I used to defend myself everytime whether I cry or not, until one day someone kicked me on head and I went unconscious, after I wake up, the guy was shocked and crying because of his own kick, and then I shouted out loud to an extent where it reached the girls dorm, i was angry, sad, shocked, confused, why me that deserve that, I tried to defend myself so that people stop annoying me, that day I went back to home did not eat, my mom said this time it is not necessary to defend myself back if it is gonna be dangerous for me, i think I had mixed feelings at that moment, anyway, the rest of the days were spent on going to principal if it worth a deal in case someone annoyed me, cause I was trying to protect myself, I moved to New school the next year, ex friends from ex school invited me to hangout, thought they forgetten about all of it, but, they brought someone else to annoy me, I got mad when I got back to house and mom said that I complain alot, even though I am not complaining out of nothing, anyway in new school, nothing major happened, things almost went smooth, and after I finished school, something inside of me woke up, I did not accept something inside of me, I wanted to prove myself to myself, so I wanted to be able to stand out for myself, rn small situations where I succeed and sometimes I fail, but nothing too major, anyway I sometimes can't get over what happend to me in the past, it is feel of guilt, hard feelings, sadness, anger, mixed of bad feeling, it comes from time to time,but I am trying to improve myself everyday. So how should i get over it, and how do i improve myself more?

"  You tried to kill yourself tonight. You tried to hang yourself with a belt and it came undone. You have had a some drinks but you've felt this way for a long time. You don't remember the last time you've been happy. You can remember one time in early highschool where life felt good and things were going good. You have been chasing that feeling the rest of your life but never found it. All you want is someone to love who loves you
You've always been the one on the outside watching other people in relationships love each other and you've never wanted something more in your life. One day you meet a girl who you fall for so hard you will never be the same again. She puts you through the ringer and treats you awful sometimes. You don't understand why you love this girl so much. You think about how you could feel so deeply for someone who doesn't have the emotional depth of feeling to understand why or how she hurts you so much. When she hurts you hurt so much more. You would do anything to take this girls pain away or do anything to be there for her. She never understands how much you have been through for her and you know she will never understand how another person could love her as deep and as unconditional as you do. You wish you could be everything she wants and you try your best to be that for her but its never enough, you are not enough. You tell her you love her all the time but you never hear it back but you just want her to know how much she's loved even if all you want more then anything is for her to feel the same. You would rather die then ever make her feel like how she makes you feel. You've always felt things deeper then other people, sometimes you wish you could go back to when you felt nothing, you hate that this girl made you feel again. You have this idea in your head that this is the girl you want to spend the rest of your life with, you want to wake up next to her yesterday and stare into her beautiful eyes and get lost in them forever. You want to give her the life that she's been searching for so her smile never leaves here face. You hate that you love her but you hate the fact the most that she could never grasp how much she means to you, you understand to a degree because you aren't like other people. You have always been different and a normal person would have given up on her a long time ago. You ask God all the time why you can't be as cold as all the other people in your life. You feel stuck and selfish because you don't want to live anymore but your dad just died of cancer a month ago and your sister died from cancer a year ago. How can you try and leave your mom who couldn't take it if she lost another family member or your nephew who you adopted because he has no parents now. Your best friend of ten years, your dog who is the only reason you have made it this far is gone. She stopped eating and you had to put her down. The part that still breaks your heart is she was still wagging her tail on the way into the vet and you can't take remembering watching her die while you held her paw.  You don't know what to do but you can feel the fire and you are on the roof.",1

"(Quickly before you continue, I’ve been told mean shit too, I’m not saying I’ve only ever been told I’m smart)

My whole life people say “ohh your a smart kid you just need to try” and “your actually smart when you want to be” and other shit like that. 

Now, I’ve had undiagnosed adhd up until last year when it magically turned into diagnosed and now medicated adhd. I feel like that plays a major role in the reason I used to be told that. Because I would always act funny or not bother trying because I wasn’t interested, then they would say those comments.

But now it’s turned into this thing in my head where it’s super important to me to be really smart, because I feel like I’m able to be smarter now (if that makes sense). So I’m going through my day constantly looking for examples where I did something that supports the theory of me being smart or smarter and whenever I find anything that makes me intellectually inferior to others I feel like a dumbass and a pos for thinking I might be smart.

"Most days I feel like my life would be so much better if I had never been told that I’m diabetic.

I’d probably be dead by now, but at least it’d come as a surprise.

My family wouldn’t have to think “if only he took better care of himself.”

My death would be unavoidable, rather than due to my own incompetence.",1
"I'm so tired for feeling like this but the thought of not being good enough eats me alive. I'm in a relationship for 3 years and I'm still jealous over the girls my bf follows on instagram. It makes me feel like I'm not his type, even when he tells me that he loves me and all. I'm curvy and even though he follows curvy girls, he also follows skinny ones and I swear to god, I developed an ed and lost 22 lbs. I can't eat now and I feel sick all the time. I hate myself. He told me he doesn't even look at them that much and he only looks at the face, not really the body. I'm ugly and I doesn't look like them.",1
"Today and this week was pretty bad. I feel like I’ve been spinning my wheels for about a month now. I know all the information - the triggers, the patterns, etc. I’ve gone backwards and it’s really... well, depressing.

"I have 6 years of experience in my job and in that time I became the face of the business. I was in our ads, taught all the classes, was paid to travel the country for business and instructional seminars, and have impacted the lives of hundreds. This place also made me into the person I am today. I went 18 months without leaving the house because of anxiety and agoraphobia. I joined and this job helped me lose 70 pounds and overcome those demons. I am a radically different person and am deeply indebted to the owner, students, and instructors for my progress. 

Recently, I lost my role as head instructor. The owner responsible for building me up so much went through a stress in his life and the problems I tried to ignore for years were magnified. He began micromanaging everything I did and the positive attitude I had finally broke. I've willingly put in large amounts of unpaid overtime nearly every week for three years. I've willingly avoided taking more than one vacation day off a year because I don't want to burden anyone. I've responded to every one of his nearly daily ""off the clock"" messages that never seem to miss a holiday or fail to wake me up at 6 am. I said yes to everything for years and his indecisiveness and constant changes in strategy caught up to him and I took the blame for following his orders. I finally woke up to his narcissism after I made an announcement I knew would result in a small number of members being temporarily unhappy and he blew up on a Saturday night. He strongly suggested for months we cancel our lowest-attended class that was only an extra-training session and when I made the post, he sent walls of text to all of us staff chastising me for it and publicly posted that I was unauthorized to make that post. He had the balls to say what I wrote was not even ""discussed"" which is absolutely false. He freaked out over the three disappointed reactions to it and I was moved to part-time on our next meeting and I am now training my replacement. 

That was the last straw in a long timeline against me he has been building for months. He also exploded on me over our overall class schedule. We've changed the class schedule at least once a year since I started and that has never been done by me. He got angry that the schedule (that he made) was way too confusing and the root of our student retention problems. He blamed me for the scheduling of our most popular class that he acted surprised to discover was at the time it was when it's been almost a full year since we began our current schedule that he set. My only role was in editing the document we had printed which accurately reflected what we were teaching.

He has also asked us to change what we teach and our curriculum about every 3 months since I began. I have formatted hundreds of pages of our curriculum with just as many unfinished before he asked me to switch what I taught again. Every time we switch, he acts surprised and frustrated at me for his changes. 

Thanksgiving time last year, he asked me to make a post saying we were closed for the holiday and taking a few additional days off in consideration of our area's general uneasiness with COVID numbers but secretly me along with all other staff members had it. I made the post exactly how he wanted. My mistake was attaching a simple stock image to go along with it saying ""We're closed, but still awesome!"". That photo sent him into a meltdown and he sent me half a dozen texts on how I am going to ruin his business because that photo would give the public the impression we're closed for COVID (?). Then he called me saying the same thing. Then he sent another dozen texts saying the same thing again. I literally begged him to have mercy in the middle of the night for including a stock image that I instantly deleted. 

I never went an hour without thinking about my job. I can not hold a conversation that does not include martial arts. I do not have friends or a close family, this job was that for me. I dropped out of school for this. I have blindly put up with years of this disrespect towards me and been a slave to my dream career for only $24,000 a year. 

I made this job my life. I said yes to everything and never wanted to risk making anyone unhappy. I make it all sound bad but I stayed for as long as I have because the owner along with everyone else has changed my life for the better. The owner is charismatic, inspirational, and relentlessly driven for success, and always preached how the academy's success would be our success. Outside of class, I have watched his kids, personally trained with him hundreds of times, traveled the country with him on half a dozen business and training trips, and learned everything I knew about martial arts from him. I am depressed that it's all coming to an end how it is. 

I am not respected by him. His patience for me is gone and what we've built over so many years is now broken. This was my dream career and I literally did not see myself leaving for anywhere else up until I was moved to part-time over making that class cancelation announcement recently. I will not lose my highly-driven attitude over this. I will never work for free again though. I will better stand up for myself when attacked over my decision-making and actions. I will always have a ""plan-B' career so I have the freedom to leave when staying is harmful to my mental health and professional growth. I will not let anyone take advantage of my positive attitude. 

I created my first resume and applied for my first job ever. I initially planned to secure a better job before resigning but this is just too much. I liked it. I was good at it. I felt alive. But despite my growth here, staying in this environment has trade-offs I wasn't even aware I was making. I have gone back and forth for two weeks now but the decision is clear, I need to leave.",1
"Okay, so I'm staring down the barrel of the gun of a pretty shitty life. Right now I'm in college and let's just say things are not looking good. For better or worse, my brain just tends to look ahead. Let's say I have to drop out, after all of my hardwork to get here.

Naturally, I am inclined to kill myself. But, I don't think that's a very good idea for a few big reasons. So I'm very curious what kinds of ideas you all might have of things to do other than kill myself. Any cool suggestions of things to try when your dreams are dead and all hope is lost? All answers welcome, especially creative ones!",1
"I'm in my 20's and I'm living at home for damn near nothing every month in a very nice house, My parents love me, my friends love me. Yet for some reason, for the last 3 years I've hated myself. 

I've sabotaged my own career by rejecting obvious upgrades in my field to continue working at a sandwich shop. I've ruined basically every relationship I have; male by being incredibly rude to them, female by being mean or making unwanted advances because I feel I don't deserve their attention. 

I drink to excess and smoke weed every day of my life just to make it through my day, and simply find it difficult to find reasons to continue on. It just seems like I'm going to be doing this forever, disappointing those who believe in me and hurting those who take the chance of getting close to me. Anyone feel the same?",1
"Two days ago, I started cutting (superficially, drew a little blood, but nothing too deep) and it relieved a lot of stress. 

I want to jist take klonopin to take it all away. 

It's not the main reason (I have a lot of trauma and stress piled up) but my lack of self confidence took an enormous toll on my mental health.

Today I ""punished"" myself by eating nothing but an apple for the entire day before going to the gym for an intesne workout session.

I nearly passed out.

When I came home, I took 4 mg of klonopin (which is cery little) and threw up, only to take 2 more after that.

I ended up having some.rice with vegetables so I didn't pass out, but now I feel horribly guilty fo eating anything at all.

I can't even tell what's wrong with me anymore. I'm not overweight or underweight or anything, I just got a bit bigger during the pandemic and it ruined my self confidence, so now I'm go9ng to the gym 5 times a week and trying to incorp9rate a minimal calorie diet.

Obviously, this didn't work. So I'm just not going to eat much on days I don't work out.

Still, I want to cut. I want to take more benzos. I went to a therapist and he told me to please seek urgent psychiatric help.

Since last decwmber, I edned up in mental wards because I tried to kill myself twice. I don't know what to do anymore. Every time I feel I'm doing better, I suddenly do worse.

I overheard my therapist calling me a ""high risl patient"" but I don't feel like killing myself, more like, disappearing.",1
"I will be seeing the psychiatrist on monday for what I believe is mild (maybe moderate) depression. I have read that the first few antidepressants might not work for you.

My questions are:
1) What does it mean that antidepressants dont work on you and how do you know if they dont?

2) Is there anyone who improved on the first antidepressant prescribed to them?

3) If a sibling I have was prescribed a certain antidepressant, and it worked for her, will it work for me too?

I feel like I either have mild or moderate depression or maybe high functioning depression.",1

I have been putting off my thesis for months after I told my promotor I have depression in March. I promised her to get back at it in September but I couldn’t bring myself to work on it until today. I should’ve sent her emails explaining my situation but I keep delaying because everything related to my thesis triggers anxiety and turmoil inside me. Yesterday my promotor sent me an email which I dread to open. It took me a mountainous amount of energy, some tears, and screams to open it, and I found out that she was asking how I am doing and reminded me that my thesis is a part of a bigger project and that basically, I need to start working on it and update her. I feel guilty to the bones now.
I know, this probably sounds very childish and desperate but could anyone here help me draft my email? I have the draft already but I don't know if the content is appropriate enough.

"Before all of of this, I used care about my friends and just anyone around my circle. I was naive but still very good intentioned.

I started to lose interest in the things that I loved, no longer care about my friends (probably mostly because a lot of them took my kindness for granted), and I truly do not care if others are suffering. For instance, this one guy suddenly collapsed in the middle of a crowded street and I didn't even care. I just walked straight pass him and didn't care whether he was ok or not. 

I keep telling myself to keep moving forward because until I reach the end of the road, I don't know what it is going to be like. But I feel like if I keep moving forward like I do, I seriously doubt that I will forge a meaningful relationship (I want to get married and have kids in spite of what I have). I want to be able to enjoy the things I love but I doubt that I will ever care about others like I used to and I don't want to ever care about others like I used to. Just the ones that matter. But I feel like I won't be able to make that relationship.",1
"THIS IS A LOOONG POST 

When I was 6th grade, it was last day of school I had group of friends to hangout with, anyway there is this friend we made fun of, he let go 2 of my friends, but then kicked me, I was shocked as why he kicked me and not my friends, anyway I did not kick him back (idk why? Is it because I was shocked? Afraid?... Idk) anyway after I finished my exam, I went to my mom crying about the situation, mom shouted at me for not defending myself, because I should have to, ok 6th grade finished,in 7th grade someone did not let me play football with the rest of class, so I decided to tell the principal about it, i did not like the idea of me being left out, it was not fair, anyway he got angry at me and pushed me, and I cried for not being that strong, anyway I cried to mom again, forgetting what happend to me in 6th grade, and I got kicked by mom for not defending myself, this is where my ocd started, next day I kicked him in his neck and told him this is for pushing me, well, then I cried, guess I was not that strong, anyway, I used to defend myself everytime whether I cry or not, until one day someone kicked me on head and I went unconscious, after I wake up, the guy was shocked and crying because of his own kick, and then I shouted out loud to an extent where it reached the girls dorm, i was angry, sad, shocked, confused, why me that deserve that, I tried to defend myself so that people stop annoying me, that day I went back to home did not eat, my mom said this time it is not necessary to defend myself back if it is gonna be dangerous for me, i think I had mixed feelings at that moment, anyway, the rest of the days were spent on going to principal if it worth a deal in case someone annoyed me, cause I was trying to protect myself, I moved to New school the next year, ex friends from ex school invited me to hangout, thought they forgetten about all of it, but, they brought someone else to annoy me, I got mad when I got back to house and mom said that I complain alot, even though I am not complaining out of nothing, anyway in new school, nothing major happened, things almost went smooth, and after I finished school, something inside of me woke up, I did not accept something inside of me, I wanted to prove myself to myself, so I wanted to be able to stand out for myself, rn small situations where I succeed and sometimes I fail, but nothing too major, anyway
I sometimes can't get over what happend to me in the past, it is feel of guilt, hard feelings, sadness, anger, mixed of bad feeling, it comes from time to time,but I am trying to improve myself everyday. So how should i get over it, and how do i improve myself more?

"I am a 30 year old unemployed individual seeking improvements in my lifestyle. I have been suffering from gaming addiction and sexual addiction, limited to just masturbation, for about 10 years. It has adversely affected the quality of my life and I believe it has also resulted in changes in my brain chemistry which is evident in my reduced problem solving skills, attention spans and frequent memory losses. I possess a masters degree in Civil Engineering and yet I have not been able to put that qualification to good use. I have never worked in my life, because of the depressive atmosphere that surrounds my every day life. I have tried to repeatedly quit gaming and abstain from excessive masturbation and porn to no avail. I had sent a lot of job applications, but none worked out in my favor. Currently, I have forgotten everything that I have learned during the course of my bachelors and masters studies. I have repeatedly tried to refresh my basics and relearn everything, but after a certain point, these addictions pull me in and I lose my progress. This keeps looping and I have been stuck in this cycle forever. I also play about 10 to 15 hrs most of the days, losing myself in fantasy worlds, getting that sweet sweet dopamine fix. My problem solving skills, calculation skills and my general intelligence have gone down due to this dangerous addiction combo. I am also swimming in debt at this moment, I remind and try to motivate myself that I have to somehow find a job, but at this point, I am not sure if this is a lost cause. I feel like I can never beat this addiction, I haven’t been to any therapists out of fear and embarrassment. At certain points, I have considered suicide, because the mental stress and torture is just overwhelming at times, but I don’t want to give up. I want to fight and beat this addiction. I don’t want to take the easy way out. How should I go about treating this problem­? I have never diligently tried to solve my addiction issue, because I believed repressing those thoughts and ignoring it would eventually cause it to lose its hold over me. However, its intensity only got stronger. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",1

"It’s my 21st birthday and I’m spending it alone, crying. I just want someone to let me cry in their arms while telling me everything will be ok. I just need to feel like someone genuinely cares about me. 

(I’m sorry if this is a cringe post, I just have no one else to turn to)",1
"In general, everything is going okay right now. I'm doing well in school, just got accepted to a new university, and just got a raise. From the outside, everything seems peachy keen. But my brain is sinking down to a level I haven't been at in years. The high of new medication has finally worn off and now I'm just functionally depressed instead of being inconsolable. The medicine is technically working, I'm able to better identify my emotions and patterns, but that doesn't stop the actual depression. I don't think anything will. 

I've been depressed for 11 years now. People keep telling me that it will get better, but I don't believe it. I may have some laughs here and there, but the self-hatred, guilt, and sadness I feel never go away fully. The memories of past trauma never go away. The suicidal ideation comes and goes, but it always comes back. I often wonder if this life is truly worth living if I'm always going to be stuck in this cycle. Why should I have to endure pain forever?

I know that I'm loved and appreciated. I have a partner and cats and coworkers who would all be so hurt if I died. That's the only thing really holding me back. And I don't want to worry any of them. Only my partner knows how depressed I am, and I feel like a bad partner for the pain I put him through as such a depressed person. I know it hurts him to see me like this and I don't want to add more worry to his already full plate. I dont want to tell anyone else the extent of my depression for fear of judgement or being forcibly committed. (My family has threatened that before, but I don't feel like it was out of genuine concern.) And I don't want to ask for help, because my brain has always been so resistant to it. I don't feel like any help I get would actually make a difference. It would just lessen people's opinions of me,, and I would still be depressed. But I also want to cry and hug people and vent about how awful I feel. I want attention and affection and to be open with others but I can't do that or else it will backfire. Because it always backfired before.

And I'm not sure how to actually make this end. I'm having to fight my brain constantly to not cry or hurt myself. I can't even pin my feelings to one specific thing. It's everything. It's that my father never loved me. It's that my mom's dead. It's that my parents were emotionally neglectful. It's that I'm embarrassed of my personality and how I miss social cues. It's that I'm tired and frustrated with being disabled. It's that I want to be independent but can't be. It's that I don't know what to do with my life. It's that my family judges me and says such mean things. It's that I don't have any close friends. It's how I feel like everyone thinks I'm stupid. It's that I missed out on my teenage years thanks to mental illness. It's that I keep reliving old memories and getting triggered by the smallest things. It's that I hate my body no matter how much makeup I wear or how much weight I lose. It's everything. The list could go on forever. 

I'm trying so hard to maintain normality. I'm making an effort to be upbeat and get my job done. I'm doing my best to help customers and be kind and lend an ear to those around me who need it. I feel like I'm carrying a burden by how much I try to help others and how willing I am to listen to them. I'm maintaining the facade of a perfectly stable, happy, productive individual, but I'm so tired. I'm so tired and I want to give up. But I know I can never go through with killing myself because of the guilt I feel for my loved ones. I have to keep pushing and pushing and getting everything done or else I'll just wallow and let my life fall apart.

""Try positive thinking! Go outside! Meditate and do yoga! Eat better! Practice gratitude!""

My guy, I can only do the bare minimum by not killing myself right now. I feel like I'm tiptoeing around a crisis. I haven't felt this way in so long, and it's so so bad.

I'm just so tired. I want to give up.",1

•My mother refuses to admit she's wrong and a fucking asshat, so I cut ties and my stupid family still defends her even after I've exposed her for lying about all of them
•My school work piled up so much since 2019 that I honestly don't see myself finishing it anytime soon
•My father, that my whole life told me I was a pussy, that depression is just lazy ppls excuses and what not, NOW has depression and the WHOLE family bands together to help him. Meanwhile when I started showing symptoms I was just ""lazy"".
•My family expects me to take care of him bcs not only is he depressive, apparently he has schizophrenia as well, which is a really interesting thought to have knowing that I'm reaching the age where the symptoms would start showing if I had it as well
•My grandma, that until last month didn't even believe in depression, told me that I need therapy because of all this shit above and more ''

I've just felt like I have all the responsibility but no freedom or choice over my own life.

It’s like I’m only comfortable when I can convince people that I’m fine and I don’t need their help. 

Even though you all are strangers on the internet, I just want to hear I’ll be okay and that there’s an end to this feeling. I don’t need advice either, please.

If I wasn’t 7 months sober right now, I’d probably be blackout drunk right but instead I’m just sorta wishing I was so I wasn’t really experiencing reality. I’m too depressed to even leave my house and break my sobriety though.

I don’t know what to do other than lie in bed… I’ve been seeing psychologists and have been on antidepressants for the past couple of years (although have been struggling with depression and various treatments on/off for at least a decade) and I can’t seem to shake it.

Like the absolute worst time of day for me. I really enjoy(ed) being able to hope on with friends and play some video games or even just watch YouTube until late and then go to sleep. But of course I can't do that anymore. Instead I'm supposed to what, lay in my bed and be stuck with my constant thoughts of depression and suic1de? Not being able to hang with friends and chat with them in the evening sucks so much and doesn't help with my mental health at all.

No license, because I'm to anxious to drive.
Nothing. All of my 2 friends and online friends who live in another country so I can only talk with them *with the internet*. Everyone I physically knew in life from school and whatnot has moved on and couldn't care less of my existence. What should I do? What should I say to my stubborn af mother? I need help. I honestly dont see a future for myself. I know that from what you read this seems probably very petty and small but I swear this had been going on for sj many years and I can't take it anymore. I went through therapy but after like 6 appointments my mom canceled it because we ran out of benefits and that was it. I got signed up to some free therapy but it just seemed so much worse.

"Despair came knocking at my door

And I let her in for a while

She sat on the couch and began smoking

Suddenly I felt tired

Despair came knocking

And I let her in for a while

"So this is something I wrote a while ago. It’s unedited because I just haven’t felt like doing anything. I’m sorry. I don’t think it’s too bad but again sorry…
Loneliness is a heaviness in your chest filled to the brim with the love nobody wanted.
It’s the internal recoil when funny 60 second videos give 30 second smiles extended to others in a desperation for momentary closeness. Even if I can’t touch you through texts it’s nice to share the same smile.
Loneliness is not eating or eating too much. It’s when even your favorite meal doesn’t taste the same. It’s when you eat in bed with the tv on just to feel like someone else is with you. It’s listening to videos of strangers muttering sweet affirmations to get you through a few more days. Loneliness is trying to remember when was the last time you felt a humans touch? It’s treasuring hugs from old friends. It’s getting excited about plans they never intended to keep. It’s being stood up or going but talking to much and hating how stupid you sound. It’s knowing this will be the last time.
Loneliness is long repetitive phone calls and phony happy goodbyes. Its asking questions you know the answers to. Its feeling personally attacked for unanswered phone calls. It's long silent drives home with nothing to look forward to. It’s never feeling like you belong in a room full of people who swear they love you. But if you love me then why do I feel so alone? It’s living in your room.
Loneliness is crying quietly in the dark, the only place that seems to hold you in it’s cold embrace yet somehow feels like it’s the safest place. It’s being swallowed in unwashed covers and pillows. It’s the silence.
It’s hating yourself so much you wonder why you’ve made it this far. It’s wanting to walk into the woods and disappear. It’s trying to leave the ones you love but staying because you can’t bare to cause them any pain. It’s wanting to hug for just a moment longer. It’s red T-shirt’s and long tear filled drives. It’s crying for no reason. It’s crying for every reason. It’s emotions. It’s numb. It’s wanting to scream and cry and thrash violently into the air. It’s praying to a god you know doesn’t care. It’s deep hot sobs Of darkened rooms and inhales of dimmed cellphone screens.
Its not wanting to move but wanting to experience life through someone else’s eyes. It’s passing mirrors yet not seeing your face for days. Pure hot showers that turn the darkest skin red. It’s laying in bed nude because nothing fits. It’s the this is as good as it’s gonna gets. Loneliness is fast food and convenience stores. It’s jealousy. It’s wishes and touchstaved daydreams. It’s recited conversations that seldom ever happen. It’s scrolled happiness on screens. Loneliness is best friends to depression that aid the daily battle of suicidal tendencies. It’s the nagging heavy weight that photobombs every memory. It’s why they give up. Why they lie in bed. It’s why they smile harder with dewy eyes and unshed tears. It’s the jubilant I’m happy for yous and vacant I’m fines. It’s everyday is a rainy day… a fucking thunderstorm but I love thunderstorms. It’s deadly and beautiful in its own twisted fucking way.",1
"Uh hello I just wanted to ask this because I’m feeling so depressed lately and I know if I tell my mom she’ll just get mad at me and my brother just hates me. They both do I just know it because whenever I don’t want to do something like clean up or eat when they tell me to they both just bring me down and call me names, then when I do feel like cleaning they always find the littlest things to get mad at me over.. there are a lot of examples of my family being abusive emotionally and mentally. So what do I do?

I have nobody to talk to because first of all, my one friend changed schools so I can’t talk to them and nobody talks to me in school I just feel empty and numb right now.
You don’t have to answer my question I just wanted to rant.. thank you for reading and listening.",1
"I come from a community where mental health is respected and praised, but not for yourself. I have never considered I would need to see a therapist, but now I don’t know what to do. 

It’s not that I don’t believe in therapy because I totally do, it’s just that I have so much unintentional shame in my feelings. I am to embarrassed to talk to someone or to ask for help, I always have been. 

I hate that it makes me feel weak and honestly the prospect of talking to someone gives me even more anxiety. 

And yet I am struggling to the point that I don’t know where else to turn. 

Does anyone have any advice on this? How do you get passed the anxiety of asking for help? How did you start therapy? 

I’d greatly appreciate any advice",1
"Like a weird feeling in my stomarch. It tingles but also like.. ""twists""? When i watch TV it just annoys me. The voices. The Music. The pictures.. Music, games, 3D Modelling, Working, it all just feels bland and annoying.
I just want to get it all over with and then when im done with it all, i just lay in bed doing absolutely nothing. I actively try to feel better, learn new things, eat healthier, etc. But this weird feeling always comes back and then i feel like garbage.",1
"Have you ever just been so sad that all you do is cry? The sadness is so overwhelming, you can hardly breathe. I try to be happy but I just can’t and my family doesn’t understand. It’s not something I’m doing on purpose, I promise it’s not. Everyday I just want to disappear into a place where it’s just me and I can sleep. 

Just tired of being sad.",1
"Now that's a bit of a fib, people do talk to me a lot. But it's never in a personal way, or one that seems genuine. And people never reach out to me, ask if I wanna go somewhere, or just a simple hi. A big part of me thinks it's my fault now actually that I'm typing this. But despite that, I feel so detached. Like I'm living someone else's life, in a third person view. Any sense of control or any decision I make overloads me with thoughts of anxiety and how many ways it can go wrong and how much others will judge or whatever. And what's the only way to not feel this way it seems? Well just stop feeling. And if you stop feeling, then why be alive? Just end it. On that note, there was a time just after coming out a little about my depression that one person actually was regularly checking up on me. And that felt fcking great. To know that someone took 5 seconds out of their day each morning to make sure I was alright. But then they just stopped, and idk why. I just want to have a normal friendship with someone that I can trust ffs",1
"Mostly healthy food, but particularly anything with a strong flavour (acidic, e.g.), and cold foods like salad or even a lot of fruits, honestly make me want to gag. These are things I used to love. Is it depression?",1
"You know it’s hard to know where to begin writing this. I don't even know what this is gonna be, either a cry for help or an apology if I ever actually do anything. I wish I didn’t feel the way I did, I wish more than anything that 90% of the thoughts that came into my head were not about how I’d be better off dead or how I’d kill myself if I ever got the courage to do it. And yet, no matter how hard I try, the thoughts just keep creeping back in and I’m tired of it.

I’m tired of feeling depressed every single day, I’m tired of feeling useless at everything I attempt but most of all I’m tired of feeling like I don’t belong anywhere. I’ve always said that I feel broken or like a robot, never really fitting in anywhere. I wish I had the social skills to interact with people better but I just don’t know what to say or do and it’s so frustrating. I feel like I may as well speak a different language. More than anything I just wish I was normal. 

I wish I found enjoyment in things but as of late, nothing I do can fill the void and that horrible lingering depression comes back time and time again. I know the answer from most people is “talk to someone” but I’ve never been great at talking, it just feels awkward and wrong, they’re my problems so why lump them on someone else? I’ve become adept at telling people what they want to hear instead of how I’m actually feeling, after all, who wants the reply to “how are you?” to be “oh you know just wishing I was dead as usual”.

Don’t get me wrong, certain things still make me laugh and take my mind off things. For example, I play games with my friends and chat to them. The sad thing is though that these moments when I’m happy and laughing, are fleeting. They may help for a few minutes but then the thoughts come back. No sooner has the call ended that I’m straight back to feeling low and dealing with those voices in my head going on about how much better off I’d be if I was dead.

Work helps, at least I think it does, it’s difficult to say really. On one hand it takes my mind off things and gives me something to do. On the other, it makes me ask further doubt my abilities and competence and fuels the negative thoughts. The issue is, when I sit at home on any of my days off I cannot for the life of me get these thoughts to go away.

People have suggested taking up a hobby but I can’t really explain this, but I am at a point where nothing gives me any sort of sense of enjoyment. I used to enjoy doing things, the massive collection of Lego I’ve amassed is a testament to that. But lately even that gives me no pleasure, I currently have 3 sets just sat in boxes. Video games used to be my outlet but now even 30 minutes into a game my mind wanders back to those dark corners of my mind and the thoughts that are there. I could take up a new hobby but as we’ve established, I feel like a robot and lack the skills needed to actually socialise and engage in a new activity. So what do I do instead? I sit in my room. Alone. And the thoughts get worse and worse. Fantastic.

I think some of my issues come from the recent ending of a relationship. Don’t get me wrong we both agreed that things weren’t working out, but I spent 2 years with this person and I can honestly say I loved them and would have done anything for them. I miss her and wish more than anything that things could return to how they were before COVID and lockdown but sadly too much has happened. I’ve reached out a couple of times which in hindsight was unfair of me, she seems to be doing better and I’m sorry that I seemingly keep pulling her back. I’m trying I really am but she was the one person I could talk to. I wish I’d told her this whilst we were together and I wish I’d done more to show her how much I cared but hindsight’s a bitch and all that. I hope she finds someone because she deserves to be happy, she really does.

So I though, maybe I deserve to find someone too, maybe I deserve to be happy? And where did that lead me, to the dating apps. I can honestly say this from the bottom of my robotic heart, just don’t go on them, avoid them. They are a truly soul destroying invention that serve only to fuel egos and keep people entertained whilst they’re bored. Don’t get me wrong, I know people who’ve met on these apps and they’re in fantastic relationships, but for me they are horrific. Now I’ve never considered myself to be good looking, but I thought maybe I’d get a few matches here and there. But no, the days ticked on and I had no one to talk to. I changed pictures, I added a bio, I did everything I thought I could. And then it happened. I got a match! That one brief moment of excitement and happiness quickly vanished when I messaged and received no reply. This happened numerous times in the end and became the norm. Some people would reply but in general conversations would last for around 3 days before fizzling out and leaving you wondering what you had gone wrong. I tried them all, tinder, bumble, hinge, POF and all had the same horrible cycle of short lived moments of happiness followed by long periods of self-depreciation and misery. These apps make you ask questions like “what’s wrong with me?” “why does nobody want me?”.

All I wanted was to find a girlfriend, someone to do things with again. Would this have fixed all my problems? Probably not but it would have been a start. I think it’s likely because I just want somebody to do things for, I want somebody I can buy things for and show them how much I love them. I want someone that I can make happy, probably because I’ve never truly been happy myself.

I noticed that as I wrote that last paragraph, it was in the past tense as though I was no longer here. Perhaps that’s just my mind wandering at 03:30 in the morning as I write this but honestly I wish it were the case. If it wasn’t for my family I’d have done something long ago. The main thing dissuading me from doing anything is a repeating thought of my family’s reactions to finding out I’m gone. The other is the fact that at the end of the day I’d be scared to actually attempt anything.

Now don’t get me wrong, I’ve had all the thoughts. Knives, overdoses, hanging, drowning etc. They’ve all popped into my head at times. Even ridiculous scenarios pop into my head, for example, all these films you see where they take hostages and make them choose. At this point if I was in that scenario I’d happily volunteer to go first. Hell, if I could swap places with someone that was dying in hospital so that they could get some more time with there family I would do it in an instant.

In truth I honestly think if I was American I’d be dead by now because the simplest way I can think of is a gun. Quick and pain free (hopefully). But sadly I’m not American and that is not an option available to me. I just wish there was a button I could press that meant I wouldn’t wake up in the morning. How nice would that be, to just peacefully go to sleep and not wake up? To not have to wake up to another day of overthinking everything and feeling like the lowest of the low.

Here’s just a brief insight into what I overthink about in just a few minutes. I convince myself that people at work think I can’t do my job. I convince myself that as my ex is chattier and generally nicer than me, that the people at work she talks to hate me. I convince myself that people are ignoring my messages when I text them, despite them having very busy lives and valid reasons. I convince myself that no one likes me and I’ll never find another girlfriend again. The list goes on but I won’t bore you anymore.

It’s the overthinking that’s tiring, it’s the voices going round my head popping up with extra things to stress over. So what if my ex meets someone else, she deserves to meet someone and I know that. Yet it still makes me feel sick at the thought of her being with someone else. Now I can’t control this obviously but my brain just loves to bring it up and make me feel even worse.

I feel like I’m losing the thread and this is just gonna be an incoherent mess that’ll never see the light of day so I’m going to stop for now. Maybe I’ll carry on or maybe someone will find this when I’m gone.",1

"Today was a seemingly normal day. Worked and worked out hard today. I wen home from the gym and sat down to watch some hockey. 
I love watching hockey. It’s my favorite sport and it’s the only one I find worth watching. Hockey is one of my favorite things and I love watching hockey games regardless of who plays. 

But tonight im sitting on my couch watching the game and I could feel myself enjoying the game kinda but I could barely feel it because I just felt like breaking down more than anything. There I was watching one of my favorite things in the world, wanting nothing more than to cry. 

Sometimes when I have time to myself at night I try and think and feel what my body won’t let me but even if I do feel something and process a little bit of pain, there’s so much and the same shit will keep coming back to my head even if I’m able to process it and learn lessons. 

I want to create more time in my days but I’m so tired and exhausted from work school, while making time for the gym everyday. I just want to sleep and don’t have the energy anymore to do shit other than what I have to.

"I've battled depression and anxiety for a long time, I have adhd, I'm severely obese and have several physical chronic issues.

I've been unable to work because of my conditions, relying on the support of family even thought I'm 31 and should be able to take care of myself.

I have no ambition, I have no real life goals. I feel totally aimless.

I'm working with a therapist, i'm taking medication and have a personal trainer... but it's so exhausting. I'm totally and completely drained, I don't want to be in my head any more. I'm so tired of it all. I'm no danger to myself, I just needed to say something somewhere.",1

What does it matter of I die sooner or later? There are good times and bad times but the depression just makes the whole thing not worth it.

By the age of 20 as I see it, a man must have some skills to use it in his beginnings. But my biological parents didn't care about that at all. I remember my childhood quite clearly and I know that they put no effort to teach me anything. I thought they never loved me and never gave a crap about my future, that I was sorta like Harry Potter for his aunt and uncle, but now I maybe can understand that they are just bad parents from the beginning and they never thought about the future, even their own. &amp;#x200B;
When I was little, 10 yo, and I been telling to them that I want to sing, and instead for the right thought like - ""ok, if you wanna sing, that means we'll send you on singing lessons"" they did nothing, then I said I wanna make movies and again they didn't even bother buying me a camera...cheap used one. THey didn't try to think about my future AT ALL. SHe (mother) didn't teach me anything, she was overcaring, she did my homework for me, she made me stay homeschooled so I wouldn't meet bad people, so now I'm scared of people in society, teachers never tried to challenge my real knowledge of the subject, they gave me A all the time even when I knew nothing just because my... mom gave them a cup of tea and hot sandwiches... I feel like they broke me. Now I have PTHD (right spelling?), bad memory, depression, constant fear.... Plus, I have problems with my physical health, my teeth are embarrassingly crooked (also a thing that follows me since I was like 7-8, and they never thought of fixing it while I was still little and that was cheap and fast, now it's super expensive and dangerous)... &amp;#x200B;
THey thought are telling me that it's my fault because I didn't want to go to college they ve suggested me (shitty college, was advised just because free). I told them that I'm in big fear for my life because when I'm 21 I need just to START LEARNING stuff, while I see that other people who gained any success in life already did their career starting with the age of 20 just because they had some skills given them by their parents in their childhood. But what about me? I chose the career of singing. I really need it, I can't imagine myself being 30 and not being a successful good singer. But I have a terrible voice now because never in my entire life have I ever visited a singing/voice coach. I'm scared that it's too late. So many suicidal thoughts in my head that prevent me to live a normal life. I can't work, can't do anything because of these thoughts. Usually when I say this kind of thing on the internet people scream at me that I'm just a whiny cry baby and should wipe my tears and go do some and that ""the singing is not important, if you can't sing - do something else the most important that it will bring you money to pay the bills"", no, that's very important for me. &amp;#x200B;
I'm scared that when I'll try I will be failing, failing, failing... again and again... and that's till I turn 30 and won't handle this anymore. What should I do and what should I think to be better and do I still have a chance at whatever I want in life? &amp;#x200B;
I mean, the most important thing, usually when I ask this question to, for instance, a singing teacher, they say ""of course, your age is no matter, you can learn how to sing at any age"". But I don't need to learn how to sing to be ok in karaoke bars once a week after a hard job in an office, I need to be really good at it. When I read biographies of successful singers I never see that Whitney Huston once said ""I had a terrible voice, started learning how to sing when I was 20, alright"", never heard Freddie Mercury said that, Katty Perry, nobody really... THat's what is killing me every day...",1
i have had brief or sometimes long periods of times with my depression and emotional numbness makes my suicidal ideation gets stronger…. I have been fighting with my depression and suicidal thoughts for a month and 17 days. the point is my emotional numbness makes me strongly want to k myself/ act on suicidal thoughts.. my anxiety does too. early this morning i imagined my self hanging from my fan. when ever i bring up emergency hospitalization with my parents they keep talking about negative factors of mental hospitals… it’s like i can’t bear depression but at the same time my parents wanna bring up irrelevant things like that when i need help!?!?!,1
"I’ve picked my way into a massive infection that’s gotten worse since I saw the doctor a few days ago. The right side of my neck is swollen and red. I have patches of dry skin where I tried to pop things that weren’t poppable. My mother just isn’t interested in being in my life anymore, but up until the last two or three months, she was my best friend. Granted we were definitely codependent as fuck but she was my support system, the one and only constant in my life in the last 30 years. She was my lifeline, some days the only thing between myself and absolute rock bottom. My brain won’t register but our relationship isn’t OK right now, it’s registering like she’s..gone. I’m grieving like I’ve lost the most important person in my life. I used to literally imagine the worst day in the world would be the day that she died. My body is physically just shutting down it feels like. Basic functioning like even bandaging my fucking numerous wounds that I literally did to myself, just to reiterate, I’m complaining about something I could definitely prevent. Like I don’t wonder why I have no friends and have lost all my relationships… I know I just thought 20 years of therapy, numerous inpatient and outpatient programs for mental health, I’m just being a fucking smart person in general would keep me afloat. I was fucking wrong. I just lost my job two weeks ago. The most low-key slow burn discrimination ever. I self harmed this job more often than I ever have before. My boss would intentionally trigger me. It’s on camera, him following me when I’m trying to get away from him having a panic attack and he cornered me in the break room. He was just hoping that he could poke a stick in my cage enough to make me break. That’s not exactly how the end played out went, but it was so fucked.
Ever since I got fired I’ve been self harming so much I got myself a horrible infection. I could afford exactly one doctors appointment, $45 and the antibiotics. Somehow it’s gotten worse since then and my neck looks like I swallowed a golf ball. I have patches of scaly skin, the areas where I picked recently hurt so bad. Like I literally do this to myself. That’s what I don’t get.A psychiatrist I went to one time, probably my favorite, essentially said that my amygdala attacks the rest of my brain and it’s just self sabotage city. Complex PTSD, borderline personality disorder, OCD, ADD, and I think it’s all caught up to me. I have a useless bachelors degree. I love it, but in the Florida Panhandle there’s not exactly a lot of jobs in the history field. I ended up here because of a man, and that ended up being such a traumatic situation four years later I’m still kind of struggling with it even though it’s the tail end. I saw a picture of myself from a couple years ago and had a complete meltdown the other day. I used to be so pretty and I didn’t realize it. Now I’ve got my whole face bandaged up, scars all over me and my inside I guess matches my outside now too. I mean so well. My intentions are truly only to help other people, support those that need it. To be the person that I needed when I was at my lowest for someone else. When theDarkness blocks out the light. People always say let me know if you need anything! I am here for you! But you have to be careful when you say that to me. I’ve had more than a couple men tell me they wanted to marry me… I’m 30 and single so clearly you can see how that worked out. When the rubber hits the road it’s too much. I know my mom is an alcoholic and that’s a mitigating factor in her behavior, but it doesn’t hurt any less.
My cat and my dog are sitting on either side of me and I feel like they’re being nice to each other just to make me feel better. My best friend has been irritated with me and has his own stuff going on which I totally get it, but I’m just so down all the time I the last week or so. I’d be annoyed if I was him too, but he is kind of being a dick.
I certainly have made choices that put me where I am, and my eternal struggle is that I blamed everyone else for the first half of my life,but now I just blame myself. Borderline takes over and it’s either one extreme or the other but it comes off sounds like a pity party…but really I’m just getting my thoughts out in order to analyze them. Guess I shouldn’t use other people as sounding boards anymore. I feel like I’m just scared to talk to anyone about anything anymore. I am already in a weird place with a short fuse, if somebody said the wrong thing and it caused friction God knows how upset I would get. I can’t stand crying anymore. The one fucking job interview I’ve had since I got fired – I fucking cried! Fucking cried in the goddamn interview! What the fuck what the actual fuck. Never going back to that store again. I have so much more to say but I’m going to stop. I hate the mobile app and I’m tired of listening to myself talk. I didn’t have the energy to type this but I wanted to get it out. There’s probably a bunch of typos, and it’s rambling..But I just had to get it out somewhere other than Google docs. My heads killing me and I probably need to eat. All I want is tomorrow to be better than today.",1
"Its honestly crazy to me. My parents have been controlling, constant yelling and basically treating me likw a kid my whole life. My sister and I had a shitty relationship, she was constantly disturbing me and i get in to arguments with her. 

I decided to move out and live on my own and I met an old crush i had who was very nice, empathetic and bubbly back then. We started dating, little did i know that these past few years shes changed so much she ends up being psycho and getting pissed at me for shitty things. She was also a drug and alcohol addict. She was controlling and used my money alot for drugs and stole my wallet. She didnt allow me to go out with anyone and constantly thought i was cheating. she would invade my privacy and go through my stuff. 

Not mention shitty teachers who didnt understand me and made fun of me for my adhd and bad anxiety. Also as a brown short guy i face alot of judgement by everyone.

Like i cant believe all this. How did everything go this bad. Why cant i find people i can trust? Why is god punishing me? Wtf did i do? 

LOL",1
"… until my knuckles are bleeding.
That’s what’s ahead. That’s the life ahead of me. I regret nothing. F—- depression… mental illness… OCD… schizotypal disorder… delusion disorder… dissociation… and whatever else I might have…
I just want to keep fighting until I bleed to death.",1
"Seriously though, I have not felt this terrible since 2 years ago when I had my full breakdown in front of her. I was completely fine until like 2 months ago when I started just being not fine again. And I’m almost maxed out on my med dosage so who knows what I’ll do!!!!",1
"Hi. So over the past few days I’ve been really stressing. I have a group project for a class where we create a presentation and record it which we did and we’re going to submit it soon.
The thing is I keep stressing that I plagiarized. Now here’s the thing I know I didn’t… Like I obviously wouldn’t intentionally plagiarize I’m just scared I could have somehow done it unintentionally. I’ve already read it over so many times, chatted with an online librarian and had my mom look over it. I want to go to medical school and know getting in trouble for academic dishonesty can really hurt an application which is why I’m really anxious and stressed.
You’re probably reading this and like bro it’s not hard to not plagiarize just make sure your not copying anything and cite your sources properly. But I have ocd so like my mind is just spiralling and trying to convince me that I somehow did plagiarize or like I paraphrased to closely to the original text. I’ve just been thinking about this for the past few days like non stop. And the funny thing is this has been happening for like every assignment. Obviously they’ve all been good since I don’t plagiarize but it still keeps happening for the next one. The thing is like how do I know 100% that there’s no plagiarism? This is honestly so stressful and it’s hard to focus on other stuff. I already have an overdue assignment that I’ve barely started because I can’t stop thinking about this. I just feel like ending myself.",1
"Hi, I’m Chris and I’m 19..

I’m just gonna write what I’m feeling at the moment… 

I’m tired, numb, I know where to go from here I just need to take action…. Life’s been a f*n mess up until this point… my “family” doesn’t even want me here anymore…. I try to be nice but we just don’t click (it’s a family that took me in when my dad passed and mom moved away). She (new mom) took in another friend of mine and my “brothers” and they click more than we ever did. I know why but I don’t at the same time, I get im depressed but I don’t show it to them for a reason cuz I don’t want them to feel bad or even have to worry about it. I just want to bring light to their day if even possible. It’s such a mind game because one minute they’re talking to me and the next I walk in the door and they turn quiet and have a smug look on their faces. I’m just tired and want them to care and see where my goals are andv what I’m trying to accomplish. I feel they look at me like I’m a bum sitting in my room when I’m reality I’m learning about the stock markets trading them. I’ve came so far and am so f*n proud of myself I know and have so many financial skills I learned on my own. If they asked me to build a website and they want to market it on Facebook or any platform… give me 30 minutes no problem. I gained so much knowledge about life and people and I know I just want a simple life and I know exactly how to make that happen. I just want to disappear sometimes. I went to the doctors the other day for a lump and was honestly scared but was hoping it was cancer. I’m only 19 but I feel like I’m 30, I’m in the prime of my life like cmon. I just want to “make it” and write a book and try to help “troubled” kids or even adults feel like they have hope and can take control of their life. No one sees that though… but I guess that’s okay. I feel like if I did end it now all this potential is just. WASTED",1
"I am so deeply miserable. There are times in life where I haven't been miserable, but I wasn't actually happy then.. just numb, or distracting myself, or chugging along hoping things would look up one day. I am 31 years old, and if I have yet to feel excited about life, or content, or even just OK with being me.. what are the odds I ever will? Something snapped when I turned 30. Until then, I always thought ""I'm young, things will change"", but they didn't. I'm still as miserable as ever. I'm probably going to die miserable, too. I can't imagine spending the next 30 years like this. Why am I even here?",1
Hey I’m 18 years old I just graduated high school which I moved to 2 years ago I had friends but after school stopped talking to them or they went to college. In school girls loved me not being cocky I know I’m an attractive person I was in a serious relationship for about 8 months living with her for about 6 due to my drunken mother at home. Now I’m at my grandmas house and I feel like I just absolutely need someone to hold I know I’m lonely but how do I be happy without having to depend on someone for my happiness or needing someone else to save me temporarily from my sadness.,1
"I am a 17 year old that comes from an upper-middle class family (most people consider me rich). We live in a nice huge house, nice sports car, very frequent vacations, and overall I live a very good life. But for a while, I've been feeling depressed and suicidal. I all of the sudden have 0 motivation to do anything, and I just want to lie down in bed all day, wanting to and thinking about killing myself. I feel guilty because I see lots of other depressed people sad for a reason, they lost a loved one, a traumatic event, etc. but there's me with no reason. Sometimes I wish something bad would happen to me so it would justify me being depressed. I don't know what to do anymore.",1
"I have bipolar depression but there are these other depressions that I wonder about. I don't think I am borderline but just wondering about everything. So I can have this depression from an argument with my wife and or if she keeps not wanting to have sex I can enter a short depression. It's a deep depression and has lasted about 2 to 4 days of not getting out of bed, physical retardation, no energy, hopelessness. I guess I could have been less depressed after but it's just those two days of like a really deep depression 2 to 4 days
Sorry if this is not the right thread but I am wondering if this is still considered depression because caused by relationship with wife or is it some type of tamptrum like a kid? Can this be a borderline thing? It's not just couple hours it's couple days. There is a little bit of maybe immaturity to it because I put the blanket over my head and tell my wife not to talk to me. I'm just being honest but they're also it is fueled by this depressed feeling this deep depression
I have other depressions outside of this lasting weeks to months so I do have depression and it bipolar I am diagnosed bipolar but I just wonder about everything they are just labels.",1
"I see a lot of trees everyday i drive. I look at each tree and visualise flooring it into the tree and I wonder which tree will be the strongest enough to kill me. I think about doing this because it would be so easy but also easy to fuck it up. I dont want to be in a hosputal bed in critical condition, I want to be dead. Hell, I'm thinking about hopping in my car right now and finding the nearest wooded area, but I'm too much of a pussy to do that.",1
So I am 29F has a beautiful family my husband is the most supporting loving person I ever met. My children are beautiful and good children. Youngest one is 15 months old and I decided to be stay at home mom and enjoy mother hood for awhile . My husband makes good money so we have no problem financially. We have good romantic life. My parents inlaw loves me . Literally everything lots of people would want is I got . But I am feeling so unsatisfied. I don’t know why I feel like I have to do something and be successful and make good money you know be important person and be a boss. And I don’t feel good I am not enjoying my life my brain is always in the air wondering something other while my husband is enjoying fatherhood. Bcz of this I feel so much depressed and guilty. I don’t know what to do :( why do I have to be like this. Why can’t I be happy with what I have …. I am wondering if there is anyone has the same feeling or had and went through it ?! Thank you 😊,1
I’m so tired of people acting like there is a fucking solution. I’m so tired of being told it’s going to get better because it dosent. I’m done with being lied to. I give up. Life isn’t for me,1
Every single day is the same. I have no energy or motivation. I’m wasting my life. I had ONE thing to do today and I was late for it. Wondering if I should drop out of college.,1
"I'm constantly angry and negative. I have hobbies and exercise routine, but it doesn't alleviate it. And my job makes getting appointments nearly impossible for therapy. Anyway, my friend hates how negative I get, she tries to get me to be less negative and angry because it affects her. Well I tried to tell her something positive today and I barely got a response at all, but then I made ONE negative comment and she blew up at me for being negative, telling me that sometimes I come across as a bitch and that I am negative about every single thing. I was feeling really good for once today!, I was really excited to share my good news and she didn't give one fuck. I don't know how to get my anger out, I don't want to make her mad with my negativity, but holding all this anger inside is horrible for me. Practicing being less negative is so much harder for me than people make it out to be.",1
"I was raised in a very poor white trash environment. I had a lot of developmental issues that never got treated. I was abused and neglected by my mother and my parents were hoarders. Was always the fattest kid in the class and always smelled bad. Then when I was 12 (slightly smarter than a toddler) my mother abandoned me. 

All this lead into me also growing up to be a garbage person. I have fortunately matured enough to figure out that I fucked my life up. Had a major panic attack and had to start making drastic changes. I found a job and had to move back in with my dad at 30, the hoarding is worse than it’s ever been, he has rats… it was a mess. Obviously that got me more depressed and I lost motivation to work on things. 

Luckily I’m on the upswing, I have 1 full time job, starting a part time. Have been able to save enough money to start putting a dent in my debt. Started losing weight and have dropped 25 lbs, starting to look for a new used car. Still got to do dmv shit… but don’t know how with Covid so I been lagging… but I’m making effort and I’m seeing some results.

Most importantly I was able to clean a lot of the house. I do have a literal bedroom full of trash bags, but I’m getting them out soon. I still smoke a pack a day, but I bought the patch, I’ve just been nervous to start… I stopped using axe body products and smell like cigarettes and wood instead of cigarettes and harsh cologne which I’m told is better? I’m getting my vision checked and going to have a dentist see if they can save my teeth.. 

Like I feel like I’m finally doing some of the minor basic things people are supposed to do and I’m so fucking proud of how far I’ve come but it looks so small in the grand scheme and now I’m losing momentum again and I’m starting to regress a little .. I don’t know how to get back on track and focus and I’m scared it’s gonna fuck me up. I’m still working and cleaning weekly but I come home smoke and sleep that’s it. I lack any social interaction aside from work and I’m just getting hella lazy again and don’t know how I’m gonna make it",1
Just asking.. im so afraid of life,1
"I always felt like my sister was the favorite. While it wasn't the main factor of my depression, it still played a part. It wasn't blatantly obvious but just little things that I felt like the outcome would be different if it was me, especially with my dad. Since she had kids, sometimes the feelings flare up harder. I feel like she gets treated nicer. It feels so incredibly stupid to say that since we're in our 30s but that goddamn feeling just screams out sometimes.
It fucking sucks. My dad has anger issues, as much as he tries to downplay it, he does. When we were in our teens/early twenties, it felt like my sister had a pass to stand up against him. But it felt like I was beaten down if I tried (not actually mind out, metaphorically). I was really hoping I would feel better writing this out but now I just want to curl up on the floor... thanks brain.",1
"I'm feeling a lot of anger. I know anger and depression aren't the same things, but my anger seems to be stemming from my depression. I'm afraid of what I might become if I don't get a handle on it.",1
"Never, I don’t have that “it” fact. I’m not special enough.",1
"i think something people don’t talk abt sometimes is how hard it is sometimes to have friends, families and lovers when you have depression. I feel so guilty dumping my emotions onto others and try to hold back. my friends are the biggest reason i haven’t killed myself yet i get so scared of opening up to them and telling them the reality of my life sometimes. 
I like someone right now, but i’m so scared of even making a move further bc im scared to add a load onto his life. Im scared he will see what i am and he will be overwhelmed and leave. it’s happened before…

no matter the people around me, i don’t think i deserve love sometimes…i wonder a lot of times… why am i here? 
to suffer and feel alone? 

a month ago my friend told me i changed his life but…i don’t know…i think he would’ve gotten to know people eventually. 

i don’t think i’m special…i don’t know..what to do anymore i don’t think i deserve my friends love.",1
"backstory
When I was in high school I was very sick, and the doctors pulled me out a little under half way through my last year. The school gave me a home tutor to bring in my work. However, the tutor never turned the work I did into the school. I missed those credits and couldn't graduate. Now 13 years, am unsupportive marriage, 4 kids, my moms death, working on my business, health and mental illness issues, and pandemic later I finally finished online adult high school. All I got from my husband and the rest of the family was a thumbs up and a bland good job. As if I just told them I put away laundry or something. I worked so hard during the pandemic while homeschooling and working was it too much to ask for to get a little bit of excitement? I'll stop complaining now. Thank you if you made it through all that.",1
"How would you respond to relatives who blame you for not taking carr of your grandfather with Alzheimer's but you took carr of your two unmarried bed ridden grand aunts and bed ridden grand mother. 3 people in total while I have depression and you said just one no because your totally suicidal by watching your 3 grandaunts and grandma die. The thing is they always complain on how hard it is to take care of my grandfather but they find it easy to get all the money and houses that my grandfather have. I just don't have the energy to get mad. I shut down. Funny how they will always blame you when you said yes all the time but when you say no for the first time, your the bad one. I'm one of the 12 grandchildren. Yeah, all of them are enjoying their life and asking for money while I do the job. Don't get me wrong, i love all my grandparents to the moon and back. I just hate that one uncle who complain about taking care of his own father but getting all the fortune and yes, idgaf about all those material things because i came back to my tiny house and let them have all that is left and all of them were fighting about the money and houses while I'm still processing 3 people that die in a matter of 2 years.",1
"At this pace I probably won't be able to graduate. I continue to drop off a few classes, and my grades in others suffer. I don't feel an ounce of motivation to continue and make effort for something better because I constantly think about dying and if I gonna die anyway why should I try? Then everything goes bad and I dive into the sea of self-hatred again, slapping or starving myself. I'm scared of what to say to my parents when I fail college. I don't dare to talk about depression and suicide with them because 1. My father slapped me when I mention suicide before and 2. I don't have money for treatment anyway so talk about that will do nothing, other than maybe making me look like a looser trying to make excuse. I'm on a job right now but going to work just feel horrible because I don't know how to interact with them, and kinda isolate myself. It's just... I don't want to continue anymore, it's like a game I'm bad at playing, I want either to restart or stop playing at all.",1
"I’m still in contact with my ex of 3 years. We broke up almost a year ago.. I know she’s moved on. We’ve talked about it. She knows that I still haven’t. She’s going out tonight with friends. Some girl and some guys. I know it’s not healthy whether we are together or not to worry about her hanging out with some guys, but it is really giving me anxiety, making me very jealous, and making me very depressed that I don’t have anybody to hang out with. I’m alone at home while she texts me every hour or so about her night. I want her to have a good night, she deserves it. I just felt like I had to write how I feel somewhere. I feel like I need to stop talking to her, because being her friend stresses me out. I’m often suicidal and what should be little things like this seriously make me depressed. I wonder why I can’t stop talking to her. Why life is so complicated. It probably doesn’t have to be but I feel like I make it that way. I feel like a bad person, for being so anxious about the situation. I don’t know how not to overthink.",1
"I just came to the realization that even if everything does get better, and I get everything I’ve ever dreamed of, It still won’t be enough for me.

It just makes me think what’s even the point?",1
"Can’t believe how I screwed up I am right now, I was doing a good Job, even applied for a better position and got great feedback from my manager
I am anxious-depressed, working In a call center so I can pay for my food (I have an engineering degree) just to get in context
I have a dog which is the only live thing that matters to me, today he woke up sick, called my boss, took him to vet, thanks God or the Universe he turned out with a regular infection, nothing to worry about
If you have read until now thanks
So I started working after we came back from the vet, I blew everything up! I hung up on many customers because the stress turned into a migrain and nausea, so In the hard cases I was not able to think!!
Don’t get me wrong, my dog is probably the only reason why I’m still alive, but I fucked up, big time! Just wanted to let it out and see if that helps me not to hurt myself (for being a stupid….)
However, thanks, hugs on the distance",1
"I've been looking for a girlfriend since I was 17. I'm 24 now and my life has been completely destroyed over the last few years due to this one issue. Been in the mental hospital for a suicide attempt, binge drinking like crazy for a couple years, hobbies all disappeared. I basically only look forward to dying now because I know I'm worthless as a partner at this point. Just a dried husk of a human with no chance of finding anyone to love me.

I fucking hate depression. It’s a rollercoaster of emotions. And stress added to the recipe creates a complete disaster. I’m sick to my stomach and I just want to cry. I’m out of options. I feel as if the stress is just consuming me to a point where it can’t anymore than the depression takes over. What is it like to have a happy carefree day?,1
"I am sick of hearing that. I've went through four therapists. I reach out to friends, family, and complete strangers. No one gives a shit. Because it's not their pain and suffering. You could stand in front of them with the rope wrapped around your neck and they wouldn't care. But oh once you die, they'll shed tears. Simply because it makes them feel bad and reflects poorly on them as a parent, friend, whatever. Not because they realized how much you needed help, how much they loved and cared about you.",1
"let me start… I, 16m, was born into a good home. never having to worry about money or food, but things change. my parents got a divorce when i was around 13. It really took a long time to cope until I felt a new normal at around 14-15. I had great friends, a loving girlfriend, and a great family (being my dad, brother, step mom, and step sister) however things change, a common theme in my story. My relationship soured with everyone except my step mom, I even pushed my girlfriend away. Eventually the consequences caught up and my dad and step mom split, yet another kick in the dick, but that was just round one for the disaster i was destined for. I soon had a falling out with my dad and moved with my mom far away, this essentially cut ties with everyone in my life, all my friends and family that I used to live with and even my girlfriend. And when I selfishly pushed everyone away, my best friend killed himself, I couldn’t believe the news. This sent me on a path of destruction of me burning every bridge of support I ever had. I blocked friends, I blocked family, I blocked my girlfriend. I was hurting but I hurt all of them when all they wanted to do was support me. fast forward 6 months and my relationship with my mom and step dad is awful, all I do is sleep for every hour of the day. I decided to get another job to distract myself. To forget about the pain that my ex brought me. I buried it with a new girl. One at my work. several months go by and I started obsessing over her. I was desperately trying to fill the void in my life and she slept with another guy. It isn’t her fault, she doesnt even know how I feel about her


TL;DR every hope i have in my life gets stomped on right in front of me",1
I just don't have the mental energy that I had about a year ago. I can do hobbies or learn new things but only for so long in a day before I get tired. For example I try to learn chess or a new language or play video games etc. and after a bit I just get completely spent and then I have to stop and take a mental rest for a few hours before I can get the energy back to do anything mentally taxing again. If I push past that point I kinda feel classic depression symptoms like anehedonia and am just completely mentally spent but if I rest for a while and dont go too far I can recover and feel ok again. Just a year ago I could play video games all day perfectly fine no issue(Im 30 now). Does this sound like it could be caused by depression?,1
List some reasons to keep fighting. I feel like I’m running out and maybe other people do too so perhaps this post will help more than just me.,1
"Context: last month my boyfriend's father ended his own life, and it triggered my past attempts. We couldn't support each other, and he stopped talking to me after a week. That whole week, he never left my side and I sat with him through the most difficult conversations either of us ever had. But I became emotional over a girl he was talking to, and overly petty because I was trying to avoid my real feelings, and in his grief he shut me out. I lost myself, I self harmed for the first time in over 8 years.
Back and forth, slowly, we've been reaching out to each other, and I've been a constant steam of support. We saw each other last weekend, and it was shaky but manageable. We made plans for the next weekend.
Last night I called him and he tells me he's leaving the following afternoon for London, with no return ticket and no intention of staying bye. And it destroyed me a little bit, but I forced myself to be positive for him. I let him know I was proud he was getting out there and making changes and feeling things. Inside I'm ugly crying. It was a hard phone call. I didn't sleep at all.
The next morning I ask when the flight leaves, and I'm talking him through his nervousness and sadness while he's at the terminal. He kept saying that ""he wasn't sure if he'd come back"" and I kept thinking that meant back to the states, but he told me he wanted to kill himself. Death. Tried to talk him back, and eventually I fled from work sobbing hysterically imagining his body coming back in a box and his family going through this again. I went straight to the airport and told him I'm here if you want to change your mind. He told me to leave him alone, and I persisted I wouldn't. Then he said he wasnt even at the airport. He was driving home. I went all the way to the fucking airport and he didn't bother telling me he left. So I rushed to his house, and he want there either. After all the talking about overcoming and just getting on the plane, he shut me out again.
He actually got upset that I ran after him and said it's completely over between us. Sadness is only a supporting role. I know that grief does crazy things, but I can't believe how looked over and disrespected he left me. I told him fine, just give me my things and go away. I even stayed up all night to engrave a coin with our birth year and home state he could take for comfort. What the hell do I do with this stupid quarter?
This absolutely blows.",1
"Hello, I'm pretty new so here it goes. I am actually a Famous producer in the scene of Korea. I have had some addiction problems with perscriptions, but when I have to stay up for two days for producing. I feel restless and I am aftaid to even check my phone. I think all about these delusional thoughts that something wrong I have done happened and I continue to just stay in my jail cell which is my bed. Can anyone relate?",1
Does anybody ever feel like their parent doesn’t understand what they are going through?

"I’ve reached a point where my psychiatrist, GP, therapist, and I have sort of exhausted resources to treat my depression. I was diagnosed officially with Clinical Depression and General Anxiety Disorder back in 2016. (Although I’m certain I’ve had both most of my life) I’ve definitely made progress through many combinations of medication, DBT, and CBT. However, my depression still affects pretty much every aspect of my life in a noticeably negative way. Unfortunately, persistent symptoms include suicide ideation and intrusive thoughts. Which for obvious reasons are tough to handle.

But I digress, my healthcare providers and myself are exploring options of TMS or Ketamine. Like many of my fellow Americans, I make less than $40k a year and have mediocre insurance. My insurance will cover a decent chunk of the cost for TMS but from the information I have available to me results seem pretty mixed. I’ve heard pretty great things about Ketamine but it's really expensive. We’re talking about most of my monthly income.

Has anyone or anyone close in your life had any experiences with either? Positive or negative.",1
"I thought that if I hate the world then I would just keep myself alive to indulge in escapism and fictional realities whether it be my own imagination or movies, games etc. but from what I've read on this site it's a neckbeard loser thing to do and I should force myself to like the surrounding world or at least some aspects of it but trust me I'm trying and idk everything seems just boring and pointless knowing that eventually you'll get old and die. And even back when I wasn't depressed I was very scared of ageing that's why even as a kid I always thought that 30-40 years long life would be enough for me and never understood people who want to grow old, I wasn't suicidal or depressed back then and I still had thoughts like that. How how tf am I supposed to not act like a loser neckbeard and be a positive sociable person if even as a non depressed 12 or something year old I was already pessimistic af? Escapism through anime, games etc. at least makes me stop thinking about suicide.",1
"Let’s just get this out of the way immediately; I hate myself. I HATE myself. I don’t believe that I have a single redeemable quality that will ever allow me to have the sort of functioning life required to be an adult. I can’t see myself ever having the ability to have a job (Some days I can’t even leave my room) or raise a family (I’m asexual anyway, so I’m screwed in that regard) or even be content with my position in life. I HATE myself, and my existence on this world must be some cruel joke. 

Enter: my ex-girlfriend. We dated for four years before she eventually broke things off. She had always believed she was asexual too, but broke up with me after a year or so of wondering whether she really loved me romantically. After a year of believing I was really over her, she recently revealed that she has learned that she is not asexual and was, in fact, just not attracted to ME. 

FUCK!!! 

WHY??? Why do I have to be who I am?? Why do I have to be this miserable excuse of a human being and the living embodiment of every horrible genetic trait you could possibly have??? I genuinely don’t think I have any reason to live. I can’t talk about this to any friends or family, and every day is spent with these thoughts swirling through my head. I HATE myself!",1
"I started taking Lexapro months ago for anxiety related issues but recently have noticed that I have been quick to be irritated and snappy. I’m just quicker to get upset over small things or things that just don’t matter at all despite never being like this before the medication. 

I’ve noticed recently that, while I used to never call people out on the messed up things they may do to me, I’m now calling people out if they do something or say something messed up and it’s actually made me more guilty.

Should I consider stopping or could this be activation syndrome? I’m unsure?",1
"brief flashes of light between the unending, limitless blackness. it’s dark again. i’m numb, sleepy, hollow, again and this time around everyone around me seems to notice. my mom finally came out and said that i’m not normal, that she thinks somethings wrong with me because i stay in the house all day till it’s dark and let shit pile up in my room. even the new friends i managed to make seem to see through me now, see past the paper-thin facade of happiness i’ve had to put up since this depressive episode started. i’m not even sure what to do anymore. i’m not even doing my schoolwork anymore i think i’m gonna flunk out AGAIN this semester. if you were to look up failure in the dictionary you would see me. all i do is sleep and indulge fantasy to escape life. the only thing keeping me alive at this point is watching tv, drawing, escaping any form of thinking about the dumpster fire i’ve created of my life.",1
"I have always been the quiet kid with absolutely no friends that no one knows anything about. I spend all day watching YouTube and maladaptive daydreaming . I create scenarios and conversations inside my head and I think that what kept me going with no friends and no one to talk to ,but when I return to reality it's so crushing
I have no hobbies and I just want to play video games , I thought about trying to improve in a video game and play competitively ,but I can't because my internet is so bad I don't talk to anyone , I met no one with my interests and I can't get any help as I live in a third world country (therapy is literally non-existent her)
Normally people in poor country have close connections ,so depression is rare ,but I grew up on the internet with no friends.
I think I have no choice other than killing myself the only reason I didn't do it already is thinking how my parents would react to it",1
"TW: Self hard + suicide.
Tldr : I have always struggled with depression. The one place I have always been able to compartmentalize it has been work. Is putting my all into my career and avoiding the rest a solid plan? Some back story. I'm approaching 32. Male. Freshly single. Living in a new area. Have a new job. Only a few friends who I rarely see or speak to anymore. I have been dumping as much of my energy as possible into my new job. Boss calls, I'm there. Employee needs help with X I'm there. Work has always been the one place where I could ignore the feelings of loneliness, sadness and grief. From the age of 22 to about 28 all I did was work out business stuff. Despite being a college drop out I managed to work my way up in a fairly large company. I dumped my everything into work. I had very little social life other than a few times a year where I would go to festivals or visit family. All in all it made me successful so I had an excuse to be avoidant. 28 to now I actually opened myself up to romance and more intimate friendships and relationships. While I don't regret it I find myself here again, in this big empty apartment, alone wondering that if I were to die(by accident like a fridge falling on me or something) how long it would take for anyone to know I was gone. Thankfully I have stopped self harming after a fight for more than 10 years with it. 4 months and counting. So despite the silence in my house I don't feel the need to fill it with pain, drugs or alcohol. I'm not saying that people don't care about me. I'm sure there are plenty of people that do and would wonder. But my nature has always been cautious to the point of paranoia so maybe I keep people at arms length. It blows because I know that there could be something or someone amazing out there who could help me feel whole but that's my responsibility not anyone else's. I have been through therapy. Taken antidepressants. Exercised. Forced myself out, even if I was alone. But nothing has ever given me relief for more than a brief period. I feel like my most recent relationship I learned so much about how I react to being vulnerable. I both love it but at the same time hate it. I feel I have reacted in anger despite me not actually being angry. I'm just scared. It's funny how I had to present financials to a billionaire and I was cool as a cucumber, but the thought of setting a boundary with a girlfriend was something I'd rather avoid. I feel like I got to put me out there and she accepted it but so did the one before it and then I guess I just imploded. Now I was to stress, I blame no one for my issues. Maybe some of this crap came from my youth, but at this point it's on me for not processing it. I will give myself credit and say that I have tried, but hell, try as I might it's just not working. Maybe for a week, a month almost a year in my last relationship I felt safe, but eventually it all goes away. At least while working I know what it takes to stay safe. It's spelled out in KPIs, job descriptions and employee handbooks. That's where I seem to feel whole. While I can be afraid that I'm screwing up, it's measurable and fixable by following the steps. I wasn't made for this world and this world wasn't made for me. I'm lost in a sea of confusion and all I want to to be done with it. Would shutting out everything else and just finding joy in my new job be better than continuing to chase relief outside of my professional life?",1

"I resent it so much, seeing those people who've gotten happiness so easily. People say you never know what someone is going through but come on, there are clearly some people who have lives that are far better than others because of what they've been afforded. Whereas people like me who've been denied so much are expected to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps and work and work and work some fucking more to get the scraps. 

I honestly do get a bit of joy seeing people who are happy suffer in some way, like welcome to my world. I think it's because those are usually if not always the people who are condescending to those who are truly suffering. They think the rules that apply for them, apply for everyone. Like no, you didn't just work hard, you also had a lot of privilege that made the likelihood of your success that much greater. Whereas someone like me, has to fight and for what? It's unlikely that I'll ever get what I want. It's fucking cruel I hate this world.",1
"I’m not sure why, but today’s just been one of those days. It was hard getting out of bed this morning and going to work, and then as they day went on I just got more and more miserable. It’s getting harder every day to put on a smile and pretend I’m okay when I’m not. 

I’m 26 and sometimes I feel like my life’s already over. I’m miserable. I’m single. Every relationship I’ve ever been in I’ve ruined because I find it hard to trust men for some reason. I’m in debt and working a job I hate just to pay bills that keep mounting. 

I think the worst part of the day is when I get home to my empty house and realize that there’s never going to be anyone there to ask me how my day was. I watched this show a while back called Bojack Horseman, and there was this line that always stuck with me. “One day you’re going to look around and you’re going to realize that everybody loves you, but nobody likes you”. And that’s how I feel a good majority of the time.

People always talk about how I’m so nice and how much they love having me around. My coworkers ‘love me’. My family ‘loves me’. But whenever I reach out there’s silence. People love me but no one likes me.",1
"Wasn't doing too well to begin with.

One interaction on the valheim sub made everything worse. This one guy just wouldn't stop until I was at my absolute lowest. Mention portals once and they'll pile on you like you spit in their face. Such a toxic community

Honestly, the only thing keeping me alive right now is the desire to see someone else be hurt before I go. To see someone else in as much pain as I am",1
"I ve been struggling with depression since I was 17 years old, (25 now), and from what I can tell it never stops as dumb as that sounds. I ve been in and out of relationships, been happy, felt loved, but at the end when you are all alone, none of that matters and idk what the solution is. I'm quite lucky that I study Psychology and have been able to self diagnose and can say that having deep attachment issues is not fun. I ve always cared and loved others way more than I have for myself, and i ve never wanted to be part of the cruel world that we live in. Its soo unmeasurably messed up, everyone is so selfish and greedy and just robotic that it hurts. So in my honest opinion, whichever mental health issues you have, they will always be a part of you, and never dissappear, you just gotta fight them, day in and day out. Some days will be better than others, but giving up shouldn't ever be an option, as much as I want it to be.",1
"Sometime last week, one of the hotel workers looked through one of my windows and saw it was a mess. They started to investigate further by utilizing some tricks they're familiar with to get more photos and videos of the inside. I have seen them doing this. But it's usually so random that it's hard to have my phone available to record it at the exact moment. 


Nobody has talked to me about it. Nobody has come to the room or come up to talk to me about it when I step outside. They just talk loud shit about me and the room outside, so that I can hear it. 

They tried to get me kicked out 2 days ago, calling the police to try an evict me. The officers weren't able able evict me. This.. didn't make the hotel people happy. Then, last night, they decided to escalate things by just blatantly harassing me. Openly showing friends my room, saying they're going to share the photos online etc etc. Making fun of me after I explained to them that I'm severely depressed and just want to be left alone. Told them if they just left me alone instead of constantly trying to watch what I was doing, the room would already be clean. 

After about 2 hours of trying to bait them into catching something on camera, I finally just started talking to them through the window. That went well for about 40 seconds then turned hostile, and into them threatening me. 

Finally I had enough and just called the police. The police did nothing. They took some notes, walked around back of the hotel to check things out, and left. The harassment got worse, and they called more employees to tell them what was happening. 





I told police about the prostitution ring that was being hosted by the hotel. They heard me explain everything, in as much detail as I'm aware of. They are furious and violent. I took about 40 individual videos last night, some of which contain the threats, but it's all recorded from my dark room so I can't tell the clips apart. Going to have to dig through a lot to find them. But the officer said if I have that, it will make a huge difference. Gave me a few other examples of proof I could provide that would help. 


The hotel staff are being much safer this time around, in terms of using flash for photos, sticking their hands in windows etc, so its going to be hard to catch. 


I seriously just want to die. I want to crawl in a hole and die. Them finding my nest was horrible feeling enough. I can't even begin to explain what it feels like to be openly made fun of at your absolute lowest point. 


Tl;dr: hotel employees openly harassing me and making fun of me after finding my depression nest. They are telling and showing everyone willing to listen. They are now threatening me with violence after I called the police and explained what was going on, in addition to explaining all that I knew about the prostitution ring the hotel was running. 

I'm tired, mentally exhausted, and scared. I'm a big guy, I can defend myself, but not against 8-12 people. 

I don't even know how to get out of this situation. I've started to clean the room but after bagging the trash.. I have no where to put it. 

I have no idea what to do. Girlfriend commited suicide in March. Lost my house. Both cars. Have been living in a shitty hotel for 6 months, and just lost the job I moved for 2 mornings ago. Then, all the mentioned things with hotel staff. 

I'm going through it. I need help. Even if it's just someone to talk to...",1
"So, I rarely speak to my best friend anymore and I wonder if I am being the unreasonable one. He and I have been best friends for 15 years and ever since covid he has been pretty distant. It sort of started when he went to college but not really since he still made time for me but this year is his junior year and it has only gotten worse since covid started. I might be lucky to get an hour of his time for the entire month. He says he cares and I know he does, at least to some extent but he rarely shows that I am important to him. After all if you care about something you make time for it, right? Or am I in the wrong here? I try to be as understanding as I can, and I know college is hard but I just feel like I'm not very high in his priorities and it hurts. What should I do?",1
Its like this brink of happiness just disappears in a fucking day like I just can't be happy every single day I just can't without that feeling of depression and sadness it's just fucking painful,1
"I’m constantly depressed, but when it gets cold outside it becomes worse. 

I feel so empty right now. I try to reach out to people, but they just tell me that they don’t know what to do about me. 

This time of year just makes me feel so nostalgic and empty. I listen to the same songs during this time of year too. It’s addicting. 

I honestly think that I’m addicted to this feeling. I don’t even know what I’m saying sorry. 

I feel disgusting. I just can’t anymore. I feel so empty. I feel like I’m falling deeper and deeper into a hole. 

All I do is go to school, take melatonin, and go to sleep at like 8pm and wake up at 6am to repeat the day all over again. 

I know that everyone says that it feels like they’re living the same day over and over again. I know that it’s annoying when they say that, but it’s true AND I HATE IT. 

I want to leave and live a good life but I don’t know if I can bear waiting so long for that. 

I’m gonna take a super hot shower now. At least something positive that has came out of this is the fact that I like to actually wash my body and take showers now.

Anyways if you read this whole thing thank you and can you please just say something I don’t care what it is. I’m so alone. Anything",1
"I don't really feel the constant nagging of suicide anymore, not as much anyway. I still feel like I deserve it though, and I don't know that I've ever been sure of anything. I'm 21, but I'm naive and immature. My grades are slipping. I can't keep up because my mind is always racing, and I don't know where I'm gonna wind up. 

Eventually, maybe I'll make my own way, and things won't feel so desperate. And I won't feel so out of touch with myself and regretful, I guess. I think I'm too young to feel the way I do sometimes. I feel so old yet so young if that makes any sense at all. I know I'm smart, not wise or anything, but I mostly talk sensibly and have a good head on my shoulders. 

I tried dating recently. It didn't go well because of my mental health issues. I didn't hurt anyone, but I'm not attractive when I'm like this. I'm not worth pursuing, and I know that because a future with me is grim. I don't think there are good things ahead, not for me. Maybe in another life but not here. 

I sometimes wish somebody would just put me out of my misery to be honest, then I wouldn't have to figure anything out and wade through all the bullshit I've subjected myself to. I wouldn't have to be mentally ill. I would just be nothing. 

Drinking was probably the best thing about turning 21. It makes me feel more like an adult even though I don't do if often. It's a casual thing, and I genuinely like the taste. Wine is actually pretty good. 22 is probably gonna be worse. I can't see it being better. 

How could I?

Each year has become increasingly bleak. I attempted suicide this year -- back in March. And now the year is almost over. To be honest, I'm confused as to where it went. It's November, and what have I done? I should have withdrawn from one of my classes. It's a lost cause. Nobody's really here anymore. 

I had friends in high school, but I'm just so lonely now. I want things to be easier. Why does my life suck? How could it be fun? People say you need to change your perspective, but I don't really know how. I feel like I'm wired this way, and there's a certain comfort in being mentally destroyed. It's what I know. And, in a lot of ways, it's who I am. 

I still hope things get better, but how could I possibly know if they will? I don't know what's gonna happen, but I'm gonna sleep in a few hours, and that'll be the only peace I find until I awake.",1

"So bit more than a year ago I had a very bad break up with my fiancé. Long story short - we were 8yrs together, catch her cheating on me red handed. That shit hit me hard. I lost every bit of confidence in my self, I was depressed for quite a long time, couldn’t concentrate or think of anything else than where did I go wrong with her. Basically every new day was like a nightmare for a long time. I had massive migraine through day and night, I was sleeping maybe 2-3h a day. On top of all this my mother passed away on the following month.. that all happened during pandemic and as the borders were shut I even could not attend her funeral.. not gonna lie after all that I felt so messed up, started to drink heavy, tried drugs that I never heard of, I was fuck all.. I tried to take my own life couple times but I couldn’t do it. So I decided to go look for trouble out in the streets hoping to get stabbed or something. Didn’t work either.. After 6-7 months of feeling and acting like that I finally decided to go and see a doctor. Well I never told him about my suicide attempts, still not sure if this was right thing to do or not!? He put my on antidepressants. It seemed like I’m getting better, found a new job, changed my address, stoped drinking and doing drugs. Traveled back to my home country to visit my mothers grave.. And here I am again.. I have missed two months of loan repayments, have to pay my rent in two days time. Lost a job two weeks ago, so got no income at the moment. I’m a complete fuck up. Not sure if I want to continue this journey.. I’m tired of living…",1
"To get things straight, I have this thing where whenever there's a noise, it hurts me. If it's a 7/10 pain, for example, that pain will hurt me for 2-3 hours if quiet. However, if I hear more noises, then it just adds to the pain making it less able to cope. If the pain is a 10/10, then I have this thing where I fall on the floor, and I can't move where the worst pain imaginable comes to my ears, and it won't go away until everything is quiet. However, even when it stops, I still get side effects. For example, I suffer the most excruciating pain for 24 hours, can't focus, I am extremely tired, and can't sleep. I'm in a family of 8, so it's hard to not be in pain all the time, and my parents are extremely idiotic, saying that “it's just a teenage/hormonal thing”, except this has been happening all my life and each year it gets worse. My parents can also be quite abusive at times. I've tried the police, but they don't do anything and are useless. I've tried everything that is humanly possible to stop the pain, but nothing helps. I'm extremely depressed, and I want to kms. I can't take it anymore, SOMEONE HELP!!!",1
"I feel like I've been a procrastinator all my life but now that I'm so depressed that I'm barely functional I feel like it's become ""I'll start living life again later.""
Sometimes in the evening now that days are short I take a comfort in the darkness outside and sulk back into bed after being out of it for way less time than I should be and I'll just lie there and let it wash over me, I worry at the moment that this is my greatest comfort and the best I feel, darkness outside and complete wallowing in my depression.",1
Does it help I need too know I'm in a bad place and reaching for ideas doctors don't seem To want to help I'm OK but I think I'm running out of time pls help,1
"Help. I’m almost in a 3y relation ship with my bf. But I’ve been really depressed. I mean I have always been I struggle with a lot everyday but these past 2months have been horrible I am so depressed having dark thoughts crying feeling like I wanna die. 
At the same time i’m not able to love my bf I even feel like I don’t really love him that much. It’s like I don’t care about him, don’t talk to him text him wanna see him I don’t think about him at all. He irritates me… Is it normal to feel like that ? Any advice for me?",1
"I am very suicidal. I always was, but recently I feel such amount of pain I'm thinking about taking the initiative and action. Therapy would work, but since It's expensive and money is a big problem, stops me from going there and trying it out. I try to conceal my feelings and emotions, because at the end of the day I just want my friends and family to be happy. But shit really sucks. There are a lot of things that made me view it as a sort of escape from the things I'm going trough. Like chronic pain, substance abuse, some sort of personality thing that impacts my behaviour, serious self-esteem issues and many other things. I'm all so ashamed of it. I feel really bad when I think I'll leave my friends and family and I'll make them grieve and really sad, but recently the pain is so bad. I feel like I've lost myself. I feel so annoying and unworthiness. I have really unrealistic expectations of myself and try to change myself constantly. I feel like I'm so weird and boring and I'm afraid of people leaving me. I didn't really attend classes this week, and I really have the urge to drink again tomorrow. I just feel so broken. How can i get help? I just want to function normally at this point and feel okay and comfortable. I feel like I've lost my emotional stability and i'm dependent on the people around me.",1
"ive had a lot on my shoulders lately and ive gotten pretty depressed over the last few days , functioning tho doing all the necessary things however my partner takes its personally when im not myself and makes its about him . says hes there for me etc but hes so confrontational about it ‘what’s wrong’ its like i cant tell you because it doesn’t work like that . he says when hes sad he knows the cause blah blah but tonight he watched me break down in tears and was so hard faced about it like damn man can you just not cuddle me and tell me its all gonna be okay. its like i have to be on full form all the time or he thinks its about him says things like what am i suppose to do just sit with someone when theyre like this . makes me feel selfish and a burden.",1
"I know it sounds ridiculous, but it’s actually a proven source of depression. 

How many guys on here can say this issue is the main reason of their depression? 

This is something that consumes every second of my day.. from when I wake up till I fall asleep. Makes me want to do nothing. 

If you do/did suffer from this, what did you do to change it?",1
honestly i feel like ahit. pure rage in side me. no peace just rage. i’m vengeful and angry at all those who have wronged me. i do not know what to do with anger. i am no longer putting it on myself (self harm) and obvs not gonna hurt anyone. WHAT DO I DO WITH ALL THIS RAGE INSIDE OF ME. i feel like screaming i hate people i hate P L G and S they’re all cunts and they all simultaneously made my life so much better and FUCKING RUINED IT. i hate them and i hate myself. idk how to heal and move on because i never got closure. cos ppl keep doing me dirty and i keep letting them. cos these ppp affect my life so much whether they’re apart of it or not anymore. i literally feel like stuck idk how to move on or move forward but i really want to. i can’t forgive them because i’m still so angry. how can i flip a switch and forgive them. i cant. i want to know that they at least feel guilty or that they regret things they did or feel sorry. but idk if they do and it doesn’t look like it. how can it not affect these people at all while it’s all i fucking think about,1
"I feel like no matter what I, wether it's sex, drugs, alchohol, relationships, meds or sh. I always end up feeling empty, almost like there's a black hole in me. For a bit of time when I'm doing these things it'll fade slightly but no matter what it always comes back getting worse and worse as I' m running out of things to fill myself with. 

I guess I'm just asking for any advice since wether its recreational, medical or abusive nothing seems to change anything. 

The feeling never really goes away it just subsides for a bit until whatever I'm doing stops working.",1
"17M
So my story starts half a year ago. Last spring I had my first major mental breakdown, which was triggered by family issues. It lasted for a very hard and long month. It only got better when I couldn't take it anymore and also for the first time cut myself. It got better, I never thought about it and I never thought it could happen again. But for the last month and a half something isn't right. It began with deep sadness after finding out my girlfriend was cheating on me. At the time I thought it's normal to fell sad. However, even after two weeks of Autumn break, I was still feeling bad. All of the unwanted thoughts came back from the last time. All the self hatred, all of the urge to cry, all of the desire to die (Yes, I'm extremely suicidal). And this time it's just lingering inside me. On top of that, I've lost interest in more than half of my hobbies and interests, I'm struggling to find motivation to do any work, or just work on myself in general. The only reason I still try to do schoolwork is that I don't wanna make my parents angry again. My sleeping schedule is odd, on normal days I sleep for 4-5 hours and on weekends I sleep until midday despite going to sleep early. I mean it doesn't matter, since I'm not as energetic as I'd like to be. And the weirdest thing to me is that (I'm gonna explain as well as I can) it feels like there's a barrier in my chest, which just doesn't let me laugh or genuinely feel happiness. I'm not saying I'm sad 24/7, but it always either negativity or straight up emptiness inside me. Plus,  I actually cried myself to sleep for the first time in my life yesterday. It's horrible and I don't want to feel like that. Only this week it daunted on me that maybe I'm starting to get depressed? I thought everything from the above will gradually disappear, but I just don't know anymore. I'm lost. My mind has been telling me that I'm just faking it, I'm just seeking for attention, I mean look at me, I'm not in poverty, I have a couple of friends, and who doesn't have problems with school, so why? Why do I feel like this, am I just pretending? One second I'm talking to friend about something we like or I'm just reading my favourite book that I still enjoy. That does lift the mood for me and at these moments I feel better. But right after they're over I immediately drop to emptiness again and start telling myself that I have no right to feel sad because others have it worse than me and I'm just a loser who can't collect his thoughts, an idiot that can't do anything right, i'm disgusting and ugly and don't deserve anything, and I'd be better of dead. It's utter hopelessness and confusion. So... just to prove something to myself I cut myself once more. This time it's not helping, this time I'm crying while planning on what to overdose. This is weird. Am I weird? Am I even depressed? I still find some things fun, some memes funny, yet it's unbearable to force myself to look happy to people at school. Maybe I'm just lazy and don't wanna study anymore? But either way I come to the same conclusion - I hate myself and want myself dead, theres is no future for me, I'll die alone anyways, so why keep on going?
I'm sorry if you read through all that and thank you. For the first time in my life I vented a bit. I know that you guys aren't therapists, but I'd like to hear your thoughts or that I'm at least not alone. Of course don't burden yourselves with my problems.
Thank you
P.S I find it funny how eating became a chore, and drinking sodas and stuff make me feel better. It used to be the oher way around (I loved cooking).",1
I have exams in a week and I haven’t done any revision but I just don’t care I hate doing it non of it I treats me I’m basically trying to get into sixth form so I can keep my friends and not have to make new ones I do t want to go or do any course I wish I didn’t have to work at all that I could just sleep all day for the past few years I’ve doing the best minimum of work so teachers don’t bother me Haven’t gon to bed bonfire twelve in ages and all my friends are moving on I fear if I don’t follow them to sixth form I’ll ghost them and loose everyone I’ve had to come to terms with the very real possibility I’ll be alone for the rest of my life with no fiends no partner no motive nothing my room is a complete mess I can barley see the floor and the boys in my friend group treat me so badly I think it’s because I’m less attractive then the other girls but they ignore me and if there not ignoring me there being really mean to me but Idc about thwm rn I went to an open evening and the amount of people there made me sick I can’t stand large groups of people especially ones my age ally friends are asking me what I’m going to study and I lie and say I’m going to do art and I’m philosophy but really I’m not even going to get in,1
"It’s something that makes me feel really bad bc there’s so much I want to do get my body doesn’t allow me to do it. I want to read, exercise, socialize, and do all of my assignments. It’s just that I keep failing bc I can’t get myself to do anything. Every once in a while I get better but then things get bad again. It never lasts. I just know that in a few years time I’ll be the exact same. I feel like medication and therapy will never work. I just don’t have that inner drive to fix things. I have this fantasy of who I want to be in my head but I’m not able to change myself. It’s a horrible feeling when you are not able to become the person you want to be. Everyday I’m laying in bed scrolling through my phone. I’m not able to just fix myself. That takes a great deal of energy that I just don’t have. I don’t know how people manage to consistently be productive. I can’t count on myself to do things. It’s like maybe one day I am but the majority of the days I’m not. It’s insane to me how people can get so much done in a day. For me just getting out of bed and getting food takes so much of my energy. I wish one day I could just be satisfied with myself. It’s like no matter how much I’m doing there’s always someone who’s doing more. I don’t know how to stop comparing myself to others. I don’t feel grateful, I just always want more.",1
"I hate myself and being alone I wish somebody would love me for me but I can't find anyone that will. I'm tired of people around me telling me I'm a great guy and anyone would be lucky to have me because how the fuck am I supposed to believe that. Stop lying right at my face. And I hate that because of these lies I've let myself go a bit and got comfortable thinking I didn't need to better myself. Now I'm just chasing dopamine hit after dopamine hit whether it's food, weed, or nights out and alcohol. My life feels so fucking boring without any of those things. I almost wish I had some pointless drama I was involved in instead of sitting at home staring at a blank wall and wondering what people thought of me and what they're up to. 

And of course the jumble of thoughts and spiral ends in me wishing I was dead. 

I hate life.
I hate me. 
I'm sick of this stupid fucking depression not letting me chill out and just appreciate the good things.",1
"I want to know what are some things that make you happy, take your mind off of things for a while, or just bring you joy? Right now i’m struggling to see joy in anything so I need ideas of things to do/hobbies.",1
"I ended the relationship with my boyfriend a month ago. I have been depressed for some time. My depression started shortly after I graduated from college. I soon found a job and moved in with my boyfriend. I totally lost myself, I don't know where I stand for in life anymore and what gives me energy. Making choices makes me restless and scares me. I feel totally worthless and hate myself. My smile has not been genuine for months. I survive from day to day. My boyfriend was always very patient and positive. He supported me and tried to make me smile over and over again. I tried my best to accept the help he gave me and smile when he tried to cheer me up. Because I hate myself so much and think I am worthless, it is very difficult to admit. My black self disrespecting thoughts scare me and make me unjustly doubt the people who love me. After nine months in depression I decided to end the relationship after four years. I think I need to have self-respect first , like myself and be able to set boundaries before I can be there for someone else. Yet my heart hurts enormously. It seems as if my existence has no meaning now that my relationship has ended. I can’t be alone without going creazy. Do you have any tips on how to find myself again. Does anyone recognize this situation?",1
"I was just on the phone and I couldn't articulate what I wanted to say. It was so strange because my brain wasn't even trying, I was just having a brain fog in the middle of the conversation.

"My best friend is someone I never met before. We talk virtually but we've been presented through a common friend.

Thing is, he has severe depression. Like really severe. He self harms, have trust and anger issues (I think) and doesn't really care about his life.

I really like him and try to help him as much as I can, talk tk him and ask him how his day was, and talk to him when something bad happened. 

Problem and the reason why I'm writing here is that all the things I say seems to be the same thing over and over. That I'm just repeating myself and not helping. 

What can I say to help him? 

Thank you....",1

"I'm not sure my english will be correct, but i try.

A Therapist diagnosed me depression. I would have expected any ailments or problems but it was just depression.

since they diagnosed me, I've almost felt worse. I went out of my way to be away from home and realized that my problem is staying at home. my parents are the cause of my problems.

it hurts me to know.
I can't accept that I can leave them. at the thought of leaving them I suffer. I'm in a dead end tunnel. hope to go out someday.

I don't get out of bed, I don't want to. I'm doing my best. I just want some love.

everyone underestimates my discomfort only because I can still laugh and enjoy life a little.
they don't understand the background, my life, my thoughts, that I live inside and that I live when they are not there.
I just wish they understood.",1

"Today is one of those days when I feel like jumping off a ledge if there was one in front of me. Today is one of those days when I find myself questioning why I was even born. Why do I despise myself so much? Why am I having such a hard time looking myself into the mirror?

It's probably because I know what I could have become if I had played my cards correctly or if any good cards had been dealt to me in the first place. I wasn't always this way. I remember being proud of my strength. So what if the bullies were physically and mentally abusing me? I'll get my vengeance in the end. I thought to myself. So what if my teachers make fun of me because I have dyslexia? So what. So what. So many so what. But, in the end, even the most powerful armour couldn't withstand the constant beating.

I was determined to prove everyone wrong. That I was valuable in some way. That I had the potential to become someone. And in many ways, I have succeeded. I have a master's degree, and am currently pursuing a PhD. Unfortunately, all of those beatings over the years have finally revealed their true colors. Low self esteem, severe anxiety, depression, imposter syndrome, etc. I truly feel like an empty shell of who I once was. To make matters worse, I was recently diagnosed with a nevrological condition (not life threatening, but tiring and occasionally painful). I have no job. I feel like I've let my parents down, and I'm constantly disappointing my girlfriend.

Anyway, this was only a short rent/vent. I don't have anyone to talk to about it, so I decided to write about it here. I'm going to bed now because it's getting late.",1
"For as long as I can remember, I’ve never truly had people around me that support me (besides partners). Friends have never been supportive and the thought of my family reaching out to me to ask how I’m doing is laughable. 

I try my best to reach out, but I find when I start to vent to friends it just ends up with them venting to me. I console people as much as I can, cos I truly do care about those close to me. But I never feel like THEY care about ME. 

It’s been such a lonely year. I just want to feel like I’m cared about for once.",1
"I have depression with suicidal thoughts. I told my husband this and he asked how to help. I said I didn’t know and so he didn’t do anything. He hasn’t done anything and it’s getting worse. He knows it is. I tell him I need help and he offers to call a hotline and have me committed, but I have a kid to take care of and am immune compromised so I don’t want to be around strangers. Plus I’ve been committed before and it did nothing. I’ve failed every medication used for depression. 

Is it unreasonable to think he should do something to help me that’s more than telling me to shower or cooking for me? Should I not expect him to have emotions about me feeling suicidal? Am I expecting too much?",1
"I am 20, been abusing substances, predominantly weed, since i was 15 :/ i have asthma, so today i feel like my lungs have collapsed. I’ve started to feel like i’m dying but i can’t ask for help bc i’ve become so depressed and insane",1
"A very close friend once told me that I make amazingly elaborate sand castles, the likes of which no one has ever seen. But, the problem is that I kick them down as passionately as I built them. An ex of mine once told me that my issue is that I live every day as though it is ‘the day’ of my life. Those two ended up together, but didn’t last either. I now talk to neither. But, I go back to those two conversations in my mind constantly. I always wanted them to be wrong. I so badly needed to be right in my actions. That’s not how this thing works though, is it? We aren’t always right and others know us better than we know ourselves. At least sometimes. Every day is a block that builds on the previous one. I live like the current moment is the moment that matters most. Rather, I use to. Now I live every moment just to get to the next, but without adding much sand at all. It’s hard to balance things. It’s hard to be happy. You have to take a step back and look at what you’re building, and embrace it. Fear is natural, so is anxiety and sadness. That being said, so is love and happiness. We are here, that is all. We make of this life what we will, what we imagine. I have spent years just waiting on things to get better, and they don’t. But maybe it’s because I can only see my sand through my eyes. We are not alone, which is a hard thing to comprehend. Every choice, every action, every castle kicked to the ground has affects on the whole spectrum. I wish this meant anything to me. I wish I could take away a message that opened my mind to see the absolute beauty in every bit of trauma, every bad day that seems like it can’t get better. Maybe in time, maybe by building on the knowledge that it’s okay to be happy, even if things aren’t perfect. I have a long way to go, but hopefully still have the time to get there. Never forget that you matter so much to the ones you don’t even notice. Live for them. Shine for them. Be the hope to others that you need yourself. I can’t promise any of these words matter at all but I can agree to also try, and to stop kicking down the worlds I build.",1
"I’ve been diagnosed as major depressive with anxiety disorder since I was 14. 2021 has been a rough year for me: 4 deaths in my family; 2 that were very close. My little cousin who was like a sibling to me was shot (he survived). And my partner is in no way relieving the burden of anything in my life. It’s on me. All the time.

I wanted to check myself into the psych ward earlier this year but my therapist advised against it. Stating she was going to look into IOP programs for me, but the clinic is so backlogged with psych appointments I can’t get my meds. 

I just want to check myself if because I’m so sad. All the time. I’m stressed out. I’m tired of existing. I want to get away from everything for a moment. 

My mom checked herself in before, not because of the same reasons; she is losing her vision and had a nervous breakdown. She told me I can definitely check myself in for stress. I don’t have to be suicidal. Has anyone checked themselves in simply for depression? How long was the stay?",1

"I hate myself so much, I hate myself so deeply. I hate it when someone asks me why, isn't it clear? 

I'm a bad person, if anyone knew me as I know myself they would feel the same way.

And no, honey, my self-hatred is not unjustified, I don't deserve your fucking sympathy, because, you know, I'm a shitty person.

But don't worry! This shitty person will be justly condemned by me, because I'm the only one capable of doing it.

Will you be able to trust my self-righteous suicide?",1
"I feel so lonely, i live with my family but they don't even feel like my family, they don't really abuse me or anything but they just feel like random people i'm forced to be with, i feel like they aren't even real sometimes, i'm very introverted so i hate interacting with people, but at the same time i still want to be with someone and have someone who genuinely loves and cares about me, so i just started imagining a girl who does, i've been doing this for a while and i imagine i'm with her a lot, whenever i feel sad or angry, i imagine she's right next to me cheering me up, and it really works, it just sucks that i can't actually be with her, she's the most beautiful and kind person ever, but she doesn't exist, she isn't real, and i wish she was, i cried over her, it was november 3rd 2021, and that was the first time i cried since january 2020, i cried that morning for a while, it was a school day, speaking of school, i was absent that day, i'm absent a lot, whenever i'm not absent i'm late, i have horrible attendance and i just want to quit school, but i can't because it's illegal and i will go to court, which i already have been once in 8th grade and i missed another court date this year, this attendance all started ever since my dad left a few years ago in 6th grade, i used to miss him but i don't anymore, i just hate how i was forced to be born and forced to do all of this and how i'm also forced to stay alive because my ""family"" convinced me that if i take the easy way out i'll go to hell and suffer forever, which is horrible and isn't fair, i just wish i didn't exist. I've promised myself that i will never go to a therapist, doctor, or any other person for personal help or to tell them how i feel or what's going on with me, but of course that promise was broken because i am here now, on the internet telling people my life. I often think to myself, is my life even that bad? why am i even sad? i shouldn't be sad, all i need to do is go to school and stop overreacting, that's it.

"My girlfriends often tells me she wishes to cut herself or drink herself to death. Then, she puts her phone away and cuts herself.

I understand that her words convey an implicit distress signal. 

What should I answer when she says such things to me? I know that trying to persuade her and stop her would be useless.

 I don't want to make her feel judged, on the contrary I'd like to communicate love and acceptance. At the same time though I'd be happy to find the right words to stop her from self-destruction.

""Make some friends"", ""go outside"", ""get that job"", ""eat"", ""but hey at least you've got a girlfriend"", ""you seem like doing good"", ""you aren't depressed anymore that's good"" fuck off okay nothing helps at all. For a time, just taking to people online helped, it actually did but all I was getting is shit back, drama and losing the people that I cared for literally no fucking reason and this depression dosent make it better probably being ""normal"" wouldn't even help at all.
I've got depression, adhd, anger issues, no money at all not even my family because we are poor as fuck that my mother needs to work in a place where the person she needs to take care screams at her for no reason because she is retarded, it just wanna go there and punch that bitch till she dies for real, can yall imagine she even beat my grandmother because she felt too like what the fuck is even going on this mf world. Poor people starving while some rich as fuckers wanna make the world ""better"" yeah go ahead and make some more money for yourself this way for sure you will make the world better and then you get this mfs that try to give advice ""start a business young!"" do that that and that fuck off you we don't care you aren't helping you just wanna fed up your ego thinking that you actually made a difference in this mf world.

Honestly I'd kill myself this exact moment with poison beating myself till I die or stabbing myself but no all I will do is wait till I'm 25 or 30 this way I will make the people around me feel good that they managed to make me still be here make them feel like they accomplished something and then just get tf out because I hate even them then let's not talk about how I hate myself because I am a retarded mf that all do is sit on the bed all day look at my phone then maybe smoke 10 fucking cigarettes every single day like that's gonna make me feel good even bitches don't help anymore I keep fucking em for 1 fucking hour making em cum 4 fucking times but when is their turn they just do it for 5 minutes no tf i am saying not even 5 minutes and are like ahh nah I'm tired so I always gotta finish alone why tf do I need to have all this problems that I can't even come like normal fucking males no I needed to be born like a stupid retarded in my own way I can't even see properly yes im blind like bruh what the hell depression isn't enough?

"Like what did I even do to people for them to treat me so bad? 

I grew up with emotional childhood abuse, some other traumatic things (big thanks to the bullshit school systems), my last relationship I ended earlier this year added again a nice chunk of ptsd on my pathetic existence, I still suffer occasionally from mental breakdowns caused by other things (abusive mom, loud neighbors, work)

I don't know what if I ever did for such horror to come my way. Like all I do is try to make the best out of life after some failed attempts, I'm not even having fun but I still exist for my family. I don't know if I should laugh at how ridiculous this all is or cry (which I'm actually doing almost everyday now) 

I just want to know why other people continue to stomp and trample on is as if were not already fucking exhausted",1
"They say it is good let your feelings out and that it makes you feel better but when i cry i feel worse for days, i dont understand.",1
"i recently crashed my car after a seizure and i just been going fucking crazy having to deal with everything and having to get stitches in my face drove me so fucking crazy and i just neeed a drink, can someone please help me get something cuz i don’t even have enough money for that shit, all i did was work up for that car, and then i fucking crashed it. i just need one night of something",1
"I don't have any friends to talk to about these issues and haven't for the past several years. I also don't have health coverage so no possibility of therapy befor the new year. I just needed somewhere to put this because I have seemingly no other place to receive level-headed advice.

Since March/April of 2020, I've been living at home with my mother and grandmother after graduating from college and getting laid off from a temp job I had in the city. My family is very poor, and I have contributed to rent and expences in the time I've lived here. Without my contribution, my mother would not have been able to make rent several months, and I have loaned her money multiple times.

I spent a long part of 2020 unemployed and unmotivated, then left the state for a bit around September/October and finding a job close to home in Decemeber. I was working with special needs children, and it was stressful to me and I hated going to work. I was fired from that position within three months. My next job was in retail, which I similarly hated and was pid very little. At this point I've been living at home bearly two years, no closer to using my degree and barelt having any space to call my own.

Around August, my grandmother fell ill with Covid. Over the next few months, her condition worsened, partially because of an overlooked blood clot due to incompetent medical staff and partially due to my grandmother's unwillingness to seek medical care. During this time, I was taking care of my grabdmother when I wasn't at work. I was fired from my job at the beginning of Octover, and in that month I jave been caring for her full time.

This past weekend, her condition had deteriorated to the point where I had bo choice vut to call an ambulance. She spent the weekend in the city hospital, where she was told she had a collapsed lung. The idea of entering assisted living was floated to her, but she declined, saying her grandson took good care of her during the last month.

She is now at home with an oxygen tank, sleeping in the downstairs living room I had been using the for the past year and a half. I've now beennominated, without really being asked, as her full time caretaker.

Even though I understand why my grandmother wants it this way, and I love her deeply, noje of this seems fair to me. My goal is supposed to be to find a decent job and get out of this situation, make friends, and make a life for myself, but I don't even have a space anynore to conduct a job hunt, much less opportunity to leave the house. I am also still expected to contribute to rent and other expenses, since without my contribtuion my mom would not be able to nake rent each month. I'm turning 25 in a month, and my grandmother's condition seems to be a nore or less permanent situation. I just wasn't even asked about this situation. I desperately NEED to grt out of my current situation, but my family does bot seem to consder that at all.",1
Why do I feel like I am faking my depression even tho I know that I have it because I got diagosed by a professional? I feel like I am exaggerating my depression. I just want the my crush (she doesn't know that I have depression) to tell me,1
nothing to say except from the fact i been so damn empty all the time. i literally feel like a glass with nothing in side. an empty barrel and i thought by now i’d be used to it. but i’m not. still.,1
"Just wondering if anyone has taken sertraline and if so What was your experience? I have been taking them for almost 2 months and I feel absolutely nothing like my emotions are gone, I can’t even cry I’m still not sure whether it’s good or bad lol. Just curious whether anyone else felt like this on them?",1
"I get aches in my chest daily and it will make me tear up and irritated/hard to breathe so I get choked up. Every day I feel the need to stay in my room. I can’t explain why. My s/o is getting tired of it and I don’t know what to do .. or what to say . It just hits me.I’m still grieving and I only have one singular friend. She’s always busy.. Sometimes I feel I should just get back on sandoz duloxetine and figure it out . But I’m scared of feeling like a zoid. There’s no way to turn anymore. And I really hate feeling this way daily. I need help but I don’t like talking. I never know what to say other than this and the answer everyone gives me Is “
figure it out, this ain’t cute.”
I always want to run away but I know that isn’t an option. Something is telling me to all the time even though that’s the last thing I want to do",1
"I don’t remember the last time I was happy.Every day is the exact same slog of fucking shit with the same cunts as the day [before.](https://before.Today) Yesterday a guy I know was making fun of me over Snapchat and when I just repeated what he had said back to him we attacked me today.I just didn’t even bother to fight back.just sat there like a piece of fucking shit and took it while everyone laughed.Hes now being treated like some heroe while I’m just getting looks and smirks and threats over Snapchat telling me what’s going to happen if I even think of reacting in any way.It’s the exact same shit every week.Home isn’t much better,I’m only used for work because we live on a farm and then I’m treated like shit because I never bothered to complain about the small things.I just can’t do this anymore.It’s just the same shut every single fucking day.when I go in tommorow nothing will have changed.Every interaction everything is just the same as always except now I’m a social pariah.All I have to look forward to at this point is my shitty anti depressants every morning and smoking with the one friend I have.I self harmed today for the first time.Slit my palm with a fucking butter knife while crying.I dont think I’m going to stop.I just want to be able to look forward to things again and smile and not feel sick all the time.Just want to be treated like a normal human being without having to have to take antidepressants to feel good about my self for a few hours.What should I do at this point. I just don’t know anymore",1
Can’t pretend I’m okay anymore - no one really understands me. Not even gonna get into it. No one cares. Thinking to get into a ‘car accident’ so it can’t be labelled a suicide.,1
"I'm fucking wasted as I'm typing this. It just this fucking monotonous slop huh. Getting fucking wasted with friends or smth in a club. It's boring. I'm faking it. Fucking hell it's 23:00 here and I'm drunk af alone on the street. They all left. One got a gril or smth and the other one idfk. It's fucking boring. Even if I got a girl to go home with me it's not worth it. Life isn't worth living. It's boring. Very boring. I don't think I'll make it past 22. I don't care there's nothing left to live for. If I'm supposed to be excited for this I'd rather die. Imma find a nice fucking rail or smth to sleep on.

Have a good one guys",1
"16m first diagnostic session getting prescribed ritalin( Methylphenidate ) and he prescribed me mirtazapine 15mg for sleep, anxiety and eating disorders etc but he didnt tell me it was an antidepressant until i read the script and my parents randomly wanted to see what i got n they googled it, they tried to help me but they’re saying meds will make me go crazy and addicted, we talked for about 3 hours and my dad started crying, i split the tablet in half and took half one before i sleep. i slept for 14 hours and probably the best sleep i’ve had in years, i woke up feeling calm and peaceful but hella lazy and tired and heavy eyes, i still lowkey feel the effects after 21 hours of taking half of it(7.5mg approximately), my dad bought me some herbs for depression the next day, should i continue taking it or?",1
I don't know if it's a cry for help but I am on the verge of killing myself,1
26/m. heartbroken over someone i never actually met. was led on accidentally. not going deeper into it bc i dont want ur advice. i dont need cliche sympathy lines. i just want to know if it actually gets better. i am at a breaking point. i need somebody to tell me its gonna be ok. or maybe that it isnt if thats the case.,1
That’s is all lol. Hate myself &lt;\3,1
"I'm gonna talk about myself in some reddit sub for a first time i think. And sorry if there is something wrong about my sentences. English is not my main language. So anyways. I just had an argument with my friend and she thinks i'm not a good friend for her bc i always talk about suicidal things. I'm actually not serious about most of those things i said. I'm just not good at talking about my problems so when i decide to talk about my problems in my life, with peoples, i just can't say the actual problems and i talk about suicidal stuffs again. Like i said i'm not serious about most of them. But i know it's not an excuse. And i know that's a little toxic for people who loves their life. And i get her, she doesn't wanna be friend with someone who doesn't cares about their life. But even if it's unrelated i felt idk... And i think i'm a bad person bc i was doing it with peoples all around me. I wanna change but i think it's too late. And i'm trying to accept that i'm a toxic or bad person for peoples around me but i just can't accept that i can do bad stuffs and i can be bad. And also i think maybe i should stop having new peoples in my life and finish the friendships and relationships i already have in my life. Maybe it's dumb but i can't get away from this thought.",1
"I have a small circle of friends, who are also kinda down.
I never get invited to anything not related to them, and they mostly rely on me in that matter.
I'm introverted, yet forced to be the extroverted guy. Last weekend i wingmand a gf for a friend, but i wanted to get to know that girl too, but i was afraid to do anything serious, so at least i helped a friend.
Most of my life i have to be the strong one and in the lead, i have a small larp group, i held forum based games, etc. But i just want to follow someone. Let someone be the stronger and let my guard down. To have a place where i can feel safe without actively working on it. I just want to be embraced, but noone cares.
In the summer, one of my friends was in a bad breakup, so in a riverside drinking, we talked. He cried, we fought (friendly sparring in the mud), because he almost attacked the guy his ex cheated with so i had to do something. At that time, i was almost in a relationship and it broke me, but noone cared. She only wanted sex and repeatedly said that there will be nothing more. I was in love, because it seemed like she cared about me. Noone asked me about her except sometimes my roommate. When i want a strong leader, who i can rely on, who can hear me cry out in hatred and then tell me that everything will be okey, i don't have anybody. I never had a real dad, nor any other male rolemodels whom i could rely upon.
I'm tired. I don't want to be the strong and caring one. I want to send some to the nine hells, but know that she/he will come back and accept me. I want to collapse on the ground and cry, but then noone will pull me up. I want to be the weak fuck who i am, but then i will perish into nothingness. Fml. So yeah, i just need a hug to keep me going till things will get better. And i had to write it down in a place where at least someone will read it instead of replying tldr",1
What do I have to do to be worthy of love from someone? I don't know what to do. All I want is people to spend time with. I'm so lonely I don't even want to eat or do anything else. I just want to be around a human presence that isn't threatening. That's all.,1
"I keep fucking everything up
I had one goal today(!) 
Just get up and take out the money to pay the stupid rent. 
What did I do fell asleep and sleeped the whole day.

Whenever I fuck up I have a note that I write on ""I hate myself"" for few minutes.. 
It ends up with ""I deserve to die/suffer"" 
Lately I feel that side of me is right",1
For some reason writing goodbye letters calm me. I get to write out why im so down and what that means for me and my life. I get to write about what lead me to end my life. Its like a release. But its also a wake up call and throws me back into the reality of things and how crazy it would be if I actually did it.,1
"As I cycle through the various emotions again I find myself asking myself more and more what is the point in carrying on. I know I haven’t got the balls to do anything to end it, at the moment anyway, so I got to thinking what other people’s motives behind getting up every day and keeping going are? Do you guys keep going hoping/thinking there is something better ahead or is there some other reason? 

Half the time I don’t even think I’m asking in a ‘depressed’ way any more, like genuinely what is the point of getting up every day to work a job I hate to live in a world that offers little to no joy? It seems illogical..",1
"I really feel awful about my self today had to go the the dentist to get my teeth fix, when they ask me if the bite feels okay I said yes but that was a lie It doesn’t feel good and now I have to back and tell them to fix it. I only said yea cuz they kept asking and I began to feel anxious and want it to leave. This all to me sounds very pathetic bc this is normal and an adult such as my self should be able to handle this but yet here I am having a depressive episode crying over it and not wanting to make that call",1
"&amp;#x200B;

18 y.o. with clinical depression. Diagnosed with it in spring (still surprised that my parents agreed to go to a psychiatrist). My meds ran out in the summer (didn't help much, just felt a less piece of trash than usual). I have no opportunities to buy them again. I don’t want to ask my parents for money. In fact, they think i'm ok. I failed my college entrance exams due to lack of energy to just get out of bed and brush my teeth, let alone learn something. I pretend to doing a gap year but my parents are clearly not happy with that and want me to work. I don't mind, I want it myself, but the problem is that I simply...can't. I just don't have any energy. I do not think that such a weak-willed human as I can work effectively. Hell, I sleep 13-14 hours a day and fall asleep somewhere closer to morning, my sleep schedule is fucked, my health (both physical and obviously mental) are fucked. And I'm starting to thinking that my life is fucked, too. I don't even know what do I do now. I need to find a job? I need to study as hard as I can to prepare for next entrance exams? I need to just manage my freaking life. I know everything. I just can't. Everything feels just...miserable and hopeless.

I feel like in a few more days my parents will start yelling at me that I am not looking for a job and calling me a lazy and useless piece of shit. I already know that though. I say this to myself every day. I just want this to end.",1
"I don't know what is gonna make me care about myself and my future. A few days ago i drank some absinthe because i was feeling sad and got into an argument with my brother ( he wanted me to go to bed, i didn't want to). I tried to choke him out so he wouldnt bother me anymore. I didn't fully commit and just let him go. Then after a bit i calmed down and he told me he lost some trust in me which made me upset. It made me so upset i told him i was going to kill myself. In my mind i knew i wasnt going to do it but i did go to the kitchen to grab a knife then grabbed scissors as i couldnt get to a knife.

 My brother and i struggled with the scissors and all the while i wasnt fully fighting with him. I still lashed with the scissors and just let him subdue me. Then i went to the kitchen again where then my dad had arrived i tried to move past him and hit my head. Then i decided to fake passing out and i faked being uncounscious. They called an ambulance and i faked the whole time i was passed out, not giving in to getting needles stuck in me or my fingers or neck being pressed. The doctors suspected i was faking it but i still went on with it. 

Today ive been feeling sad because i messes up on an exam and starting thinking about my iq score again that i took for therapy. I got a iq result of 83 which is considered on the low average. They said my high knowledge of vocabulary contradicts my score and could cause someone to overestimate my intelligence. I never understood the questions whenever i took an online iq test. 

In primary school i got havo (with a small portion being in vwo, which is the highest) as a recommendation on my final year of primary school. Through high school i did always have to study hard and do alot of work but i didnt fail a single year and passed with ok results. I also learned english from playing videogames and watching shows as a kid, although my friends i had never believed that. I just feel depressed because i felt bad when i got my iq test result. Other than that i feel bad because i have low self asteem, autism, no friends, no future plans, a pretty low paying job and feeling i wont succeed at anything such as school.",1
"I already have a location planned, but I don't know if I can get enough courage to do so. I hope I can. Anyways, I'm just simply tired of everything and there isn't a reason to keep going.",1
Fuck this shit. Seriously why do awful people who are good at certain things get to go ahead in life while everyone else is left in the dirt. Why don't people get what they deserve? There's no justice in this world,1
